# Basic-operation-of-pytorch
## There are some basic pytorch operation when training a neural network which i practiced in 2019.
Including:
+ Autograd operation of torch tensor
+ use different activate function in pytorch
+ how to build a neural network and do classification task
+ how to save a model and extract a model
+ use different optimizer in pytorch
+ build a simple CNN and RNN and do classification(minist)
