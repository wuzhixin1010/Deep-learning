You know that what I do is write for children, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in America.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or <unk> and <unk> and never had a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you today about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that fell somewhere else.
You just have to turn on the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of a complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the middle school in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the weird class.
When I went back to bleed every week in the bathroom bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life as I kept letting me.
It was <unk>
For three years.
I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working on organizations fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> as adults never come to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to get stuck with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it one place, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of his family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> he became a <unk> box and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you about is made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy today talked about this.
It also needs -- it needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my job, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quick, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them around <unk> of the water almost 60 meters, and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on a <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
The <unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or break the ice walls off.
Every iceberg has its individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment, and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to give up and hold onto the end, whereas others can't be <unk> and they were <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, largely as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But reality is the opposite.
As it melts a <unk> I'm breathing his <unk> atmosphere.
As an iceberg the iceberg releases sweet fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are in that way and won't come back to exist again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice on the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's a little bit frequent to actually see an iceberg <unk>
Here it is.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I would like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line <unk>
You can see here, starts to <unk> the boat has moved on the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg from average size.
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so we <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single one -- a baby. OK.
So two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to be <unk> too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about the understanding of it, I'm not going to pay attention.
So let's think about that for a moment.
And on this scenario I want you to imagine that, in a case, the Y and the sperm and the sperm joins the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the X X chromosome comes into the X X <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my inner activity to fill two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I am a <unk> of training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- that -- which is, of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered the fluids <unk> the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance works in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with twins <unk> two people within one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people who are much lower than the average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with <unk> sex, who whose physical <unk> doesn't fit into male male sketches and <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> embraces many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex that doesn't be <unk> in the common forms or females.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> <unk> which <unk> gene from chromosome and says to the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> that will become <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, the testes are producing testosterone.
But because this individual lacks the receptors lacks testosterone, your body doesn't respond to it.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but no feedback.
As a result, the body develops following a <unk>
When you <unk> the baby has a little bit of a child.
It's a little girl. He's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing a breast cycle, but it doesn't have the menstrual cycle, when someone realizes something is happening.
After taking care tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has <unk> and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think this is a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women, as men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman, don't know their <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> than the woman who was born with testicles who have <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing -- not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he was wearing a life as a kid, and I had just found out she had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had <unk> chromosomes in the uterus -- the <unk> <unk> were so active that essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a result, its <unk> were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone coaster typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it went to the age of 19 years when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that in fact, was a woman in it.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with <unk> chromosomes -- they develop what's known as <unk> -- they have <unk> <unk> wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So there are many different varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- you know, are <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> surgeries -- it's not to be able to make it from a better physical health solution.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that it was <unk> to various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> <unk> identity, being black means to have African anatomy in <unk> terms.
Very simplistic.
And when you give us a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very Romantic <unk>
Imagine the surprising thing that is having kids that are born like two people in one body.
The most high case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What test is going to do to determine whether <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you to the journalists that there is no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature would not trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who do that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through the science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- thought were a stable categories that will be <unk> directly in <unk> categories -- are much more <unk> than <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do you <unk> from the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we put in science in science, we get more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles to the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, not in public, but in the <unk> of when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to marry this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him got to put a pen in front of the nose and if he moved on, they still don't <unk>
If you stopped moving through it.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them into another body.
And as a result, we have to address the dilemma of actually what somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I am <unk> <unk> to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous
<unk> that these categories are far more fragile than we thought I was thinking about <unk>
<unk> from the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, I find each other and seeing that music, <unk> <unk> and not the music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the Parents <unk>
Parents <unk> come up, to me, the first activists of the anatomy and I explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as you all remember, what our parents were, the <unk> was the idea of the <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming into the right of blood passed from the father to the father and then the son, etc.
Parents had rejected that idea and replace it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game of play and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if we looked at the story of the Parents -- <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> out of the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to <unk> transmitted by a <unk> right <unk>
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of <unk> talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And the consequence were passing away from the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future <unk> rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women were <unk>
Then they came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people of <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
Again, people of color that are <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow Movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking ourselves why we keep some <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights that a human.
I don't want to say that we should <unk> to anatomy.
I don't want to say that at the age of five years they had to allow them to have sex or getting married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
So let's imagine that one of them, Mary. <unk> was born three months before -- June 1 of 1980.
Henry, in the contrary, was born in terms of the March 1 <unk>
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before Henry <unk> the right for sexual consent, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because he was born.
We find other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, by virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories -- that in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science moved both into the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where do we go here?
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do it.
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided to marry a man not have to have chromosome and to marry a woman to marry a woman and <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't make a test <unk> to people.
But this is also very strange because of the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their skin -- going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks very good."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the contents of their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure we should be able to focus on this to <unk> rights to people, because I will admit that I know some of the <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more decisions and smart and <unk> about your sexual relationships that people than I know.
So how do we put the issue of the content of <unk>
It's very hard.
And a part of me ask what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
Do you want to get that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current kind of thinking issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live in, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed unless they are willing to be willing to be able to have sex in which that case is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made a couple of years ago that I had made a few years ago that had made the <unk> <unk> and then <unk> their fame.
But when the phone asked her the cause of the operation -- it was a very <unk> operation -- he responded to me that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, has considered political asylum.
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are not <unk> to change the same state of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to end up I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy, or as it might have been, if we were given greater involvement in <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a <unk> and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if people thinking about a group.
For years, since I have been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in doing the sexual differences.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and dealing with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I was considered <unk> like <unk> made me a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what about <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing female <unk>
But the more I thought about your question, more than there is something about female <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very attentive to finding ways to protect people from the state, it's possible that there will be more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk> support.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we <unk> democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a perfect <unk> to think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go live and work and have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, right now we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth a lot more than the cost of construction.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just <unk> for buildings apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments were already owners, and that the other half is still not <unk>
You could try to increase the ability to increase in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas around them have the rules to avoid the <unk> and the destruction of construction.
So it would be very hard to do all these <unk>
But they could go to a whole new place, building a whole new apartment building always and when the rules of that place would be able to build the construction instead of putting <unk>
So I proposed that governments would develop new reform zones, big enough to contain cities and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of <unk>
They knew that every year about 75,000 <unk> they would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional crisis.
In the next presidential elections, we had <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which <unk> reforms and at the same time, reconciliation.
He asked him to <unk> her head of <unk>
And meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk on TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of testing with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those rules that they say you cannot go and bother all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes both of the technologies as the rules of rules to <unk> and usually they are the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala was sent to <unk> a bond with the <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room of a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And he used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City, <unk> terrain that in some cases, are worth thousands per square meter.
But it was a fairly abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk described in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not to live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> was called me and said that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country will move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, that was trying to explain that to make it much value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that is about 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everybody <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have it here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you could go to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North.
And they also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries associated with them to help them establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that everybody could be able to rely on the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be just a thousand square miles.
And shortly afterwards, the 19th of January, voted in Congress to <unk> its Constitution and adding a constitutional arrangement that allowed to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis the voting in Congress for this constitutional constitutional <unk> was <unk>
All the dinosaurs in the society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the Constitution you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 once in the other voting -- to one.
Immediately after the <unk> of 21 to 24 of February, a <unk> <unk> went to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that's been building in North Korea -- is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years to get the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> and they would allow the <unk> to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing their Supreme Court to be the final Supreme Court to be the final <unk> system.
There are urban <unk> <unk> cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they have already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that would want to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There are a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to go and get a job -- sometimes they're mothers who have to win the money for just to eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it seem to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it seem to think about insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> they asked me to say, "Thank TED TED.
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a confession public and that is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find animation, and more recently, photographing and publish my blog and <unk> and colorful and different <unk>
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from second of <unk> markets and <unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second <unk> stores, allow me to reduce my <unk> impact and in my <unk>
I go to know <unk> people usually get my money out of a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I would like the <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive <unk> then I feel that I've won.
So back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I would think about for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings up someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of <unk> and nothing else.
I slept inside exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after coming here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in <unk>  That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons from life that, believe it or not, I've learned this adventure not to use new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is called <unk> <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always look phenomenal at less than 50 dollars.
All together, including <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> it impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, not only if you get rid of the right people as well.
<unk> <unk> of the boy who carry in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems like I play <unk> or I remember your little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you look good with something, it's almost certain you are.
And if you think you're not good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your interior and outside, you don't see that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We must be able to get everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you: Golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal and a great way of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching me this week simply by what I was doing, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously all of this is not going to get into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave back certain things.
I don't need emotionally emotionally emotionally because in the corner, because in the corner, there will always be another suit and <unk> and <unk> <unk> if there is a little bit of love in my heart and I felt.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side, the left side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you have a scale to measure <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brains.
For example, this would be a lot of logical.
This would be someone who is totally intuitive.
So, where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some of them would come from one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not to be mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that as most of the other quantum physicists, we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
You can have intuition that you may have developed with the step of the years is the one that says that one thing can be just a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy and I didn't do it very well, it always <unk>
But I bet the playing with that hospital bar he taught him a valuable lesson, and it is that the big things don't allow the <unk> and that stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except to be a particle <unk>
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with the parking <unk> play with these strange little particles.
And when you play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and called it called quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics of a few years ago; you needed from quantum mechanics to describe these little particles.
But you don't need to describe it to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it doesn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, never no one saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if it's all made out of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I can't find the reason why it doesn't have been.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I set up to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in an quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then here we do a very big approach to the small <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little little little bit of metal, with a springboard and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And so I did this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip with a new silicon chip around 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of swimming <unk> swimming under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it it needs a bit of help.
Let me do an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable being in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am in an elevator alone, I do all sorts of rare things, but then when other people go up to do those things, because I don't want to <unk> them, or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> <unk> of inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that is <unk> and the wind that happens to their side and the heat in the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to <unk> it according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to push it to all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We <unk> the lights and then <unk> a <unk> and pulled it all the air, and then it would take it to a temperature of less than a degree by zero degree on absolute zero.
Now, when you are only in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free of acting like it.
So we measured their movements.
We discovered it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, and I was vibrating. And the way I <unk> was like a breath like a breath -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And as we give it a <unk> <unk> we were able to make it <unk> and we don't get it back at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing, and we didn't go at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every trillion of the atoms that make up that little bit of metal are still still up and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's only in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what it means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
I was worth <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, watch this, the difference on the scale between one atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same thing that the difference between that little bit of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you well?
I mean, it's my kind of logic that I'm talking about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we put it down, and we turned the lights and look inside the box, we saw the metal still there on one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all objects in the elevator actually are just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics is claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that you around you, literally define who you are. And that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And it makes 18 months ago -- another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about <unk> and art to my boss who is here and allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and it took me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, <unk> with very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explaining just about this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education, not <unk> but I had no access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go and <unk> I started to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better that shows the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from his launch.
So, <unk> are we going to <unk>
Look around all the museums that there are.
There's the gallery gallery at MoMA, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to get into one of my favorite art -- the New York museum in New York.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're inside of the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with one click, we jumped in.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall, right?
Go forward to go.
<unk>
Thank you, but I've not come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows you the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the data from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10 million of them.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10 million pixels.
It can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are going on.
I love this kid, your expression has no price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started playing play, and I found something happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this looks <unk>
I walked in, and I discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
And so I did a little bit, I talked to some people in the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a Tuesday Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get further into depth and you'll see that you can actually get the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take away the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, one second.
So now we're going to move back again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed you was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this <unk> play.
It goes up and actually <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot more things here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online create your own museum, create its own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we go in, I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just <unk> around you.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, you send her to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think that for me, the main thing is that all of the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my view, even come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope in this digital medium does justice for the work of art and it's represented properly online.
And the big question you do today is, you have done this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am from Italian origin all the children in Italy growing up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that it has happened something really interesting about the racing racing racing in the last two decades.
And for some time, if you wanted to win a race of Formula 1, I would take a budget and put it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
So this is what in engineering, it takes control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that the interesting control systems in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronics.
They're turning computers into the open.
And, as <unk> are beginning to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> consumption -- to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for a year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's kind of like almost all the existing atoms to be <unk> and <unk>
And that's constantly changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that the hammer took the hammer and he threw it up the Moses -- you can actually see a small dent in a <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> insisting on the idea of getting the environment and get something.
Let's start with the detection of it.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer for 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the remember, I played Italy in Italy and France, and at the end, <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, the end won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day looking at <unk> activity on the Web.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The line of time is on the top.
At the late afternoon, there are people here and there doing <unk> <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a fast call.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk> at the center.
So you see the big summit.
The next day everyone was at the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, at <unk> <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way we could not have done a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but of things that we use and we consume.
Today we know all about the <unk> of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how do you <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago to tag what were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all <unk>
And then we put a little chip, a <unk> <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information, we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening very complicated things, and there's no <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> not is still somewhere on the planet on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we dropped on one day is still there.
That if we showed that to people, then we can promote some change in behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and a lot of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked to the beginning, which is <unk>
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all began with a question of the mayor of the city who came and told us that Spain and Southern Europe, has a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can the technology, the new technology, join that thing?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop is, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> tubes of <unk> <unk> that open and <unk>
It was believed as a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you fall down the pixels on them, showing patterns, images, texts.
And when I zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to Mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot like it.
And they <unk> a commission to design the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no windows and no windows, but when you go up to you -- it opens up so you can pass it.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> the ceiling.
Or you can close the building, and all the architecture disappears as in this case.
There are always somebody, in the winter, when you go down the roof, somebody who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they have <unk> but when the whole architecture goes down.
Here it is working.
You see the people who are <unk> out of what happens in.
And here I'm myself trying to don't <unk> when the sensors open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came into the building because the way to interact with it had changed a little bit.
It wasn't a building that would open to letting you happen, but a building that was still <unk> and holes in the water and you had to jump out and jump to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use that people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to find that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the animals, the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that these pixels could start flying.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air, and every single one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw earlier, moving with other in synchrony.
We could form this cloud, right?
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal -- but in three dimensions, what it changes is light, not the <unk> position.
You can play with a different type.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then that all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D to which you can reach, and look at it from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light, you see this -- the same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best ballet dancers star in today, the star of New York and the <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use them as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> it captures it in different <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> in real time as a movement.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can walk all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entrance to <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people involved in order to do something and change our environment as a <unk> farm as a <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine we could make all of them <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what remarkable has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign <unk> we can move from the digital world of the digital power of the <unk> to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to tackle the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how to move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can get people to do this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but it covered the pixel <unk>
You can move around in the inside, having different experiences.
You can see from below, it will serve to share the main moments of the 2012 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new peak in London.
You can go out there in there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are <unk>
Suppose I would tell you that, with just a lot of changes in your genes, they could improve the <unk> for more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, being stronger -- have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and safe than <unk>
What about living more with good health?
Or maybe be those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else would you do?
What would you want, if you could choose something?
Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people do you understand creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> Probably as many people present.
That's very good.
How many of you want to do <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of all, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe is that possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> topic here at the TED Conference. But today I want to give you a doctor on the subject.
The great Member of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a essay called "Nothing in biology -- it makes sense except to the light of the <unk>
But if they actually embrace biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It's about the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this field, well on one end is, of course, the most interest in us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern ancestor about six or eight million years.
There have been maybe 20 -- 25 species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like the human insulin -- but it's the same <unk> <unk> that comes out of <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all have in the gut more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> is given to the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm, dark, <unk> <unk>
And we're going to provide them all the nutrients that they can want to be able to want to be effort in their part.
It's really like a quick pathway to bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk> towards the way.
But anyway, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest <unk> nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I was just <unk> I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms -- every cell just divide up and all the genetic energy from that cell is broadcast to the two daughters of <unk>
But when organisms appear to show up, things start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body goes into the evolution of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death for <unk> seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year it was happening, I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas well in their 90s, lives.
And one night someone hits their door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of it is a magnificent <unk> dancer, <unk>
And he looks at it and says, <unk> it looks for a <unk> <unk>
"It is <unk> he says, <unk> I chose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to be healthy.
I wanted to restore health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is to pass the genome into the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view of an evolutionary point of view, you and I are just as <unk> <unk> designed to send the genetic burden on the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think that all of us <unk> the feeling that put Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my job.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily favors longevity.
They don't necessarily favors the biggest or the strongest or the faster and even the smartest thing even the most.
Evolution favors the better adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
On the bottom of the ocean, the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if they had fish there, dry fish <unk> yet have been able to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we think about the place of humans in evolution in evolution in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward, to the <unk> phase -- I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the thinking behind that would be that through medicine, first we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> us so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation that we need to make in evolution.
A second possibility is that it makes a evolution of the natural kind of dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as much as the <unk> as a kind of <unk> species, distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there is a third possibility, and an intriguing sexy possibility, and intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the choices that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we do that?
You first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society but it's what it is <unk>
Think that if you could even be able to choose not only sex from your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
Don't you want to make those changes in your <unk>
If you look at the future, that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990, she sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
In the next year of the finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost near the 20,000 and a week.
Not much of us to make the human genome for <unk> and to be increasingly <unk>
You come to those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect themselves but are going to induce themselves against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against flu <unk> in cells from a plant plant.
Can you imagine something good at the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells from their bodies, but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or changing the <unk> <unk> and give their kids a better chance of a healthier life, to eliminate diabetes -- to eliminate the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same analytical technology that same engine of science that can produce changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also take <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could get <unk> with the next generation of <unk> machine.
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're going to be able to pass this into the next generation and we can embrace the attributes that we wanted to have turned the evolution of prior to <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take 100,000 years and we can save 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these choices in a better society, more successful society.
Or, let's choose to selectively <unk> different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that's more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deeper of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for bad, and before what it might be, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably <unk> some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
Often that's not the road.
<unk> the engines.
Imagine being on an airplane and no <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three more <unk> words ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
I was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to make before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in, and I didn't do that -- all the fences I wanted to <unk> all the experiences that I have wanted to have and never <unk>
As I was thinking about that further, a phrase, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open it up.
I don't want to <unk> anything in life.
And that urgency, it really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the George Washington bridge, which was not a lot -- I thought about it: <unk> I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and my mistakes I've been trying to improve in everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also give place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I think about things that didn't care about people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels <unk>
I don't really try to have reason to be <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please get <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, wow, <unk> not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not much artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> as a small one.
And for me, that was all the reason to be in the world.
At that point I got to connect those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I gave <unk> a miracle, not to die that day.
And I gave myself another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and come back and live differently.
You who are flying in today, the challenge to imagine that you can imagine that the same happens in your airplane -- and please not be like that, but you can imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is it that you <unk> they're still waiting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would your relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're being the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the most great thing that I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk>
And one day he got home after he ran and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today <unk> has complete <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation, and obviously, graffiti is a intricate thing that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided we were going to <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him, and he can be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're important to be a very good way, you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Anybody to see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, and they are <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I was presented with the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that signed a check that didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
She <unk> me with his brother and her father there at that very moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to speak, we'll build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it is ridiculous that someone who has so much on their interior can't afford it.
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research <unk> which have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then, with a laser pointer -- they draw on that and register the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that they <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They first start with sexual organs, then with bad words, then with the attacks to Bush and, in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life in his <unk>
And so the journey began.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of moving things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, to touch the doors of the insurance companies and we got a machine so that they could <unk> could make a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call him <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was I bring seven programmers around the whole corner of every single corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage, and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something utterly stupid and that when they <unk> would have taken off the frames of the walls and in his place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> <unk> <unk> my son was part, my dog also, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They're a pair of <unk> <unk> that we bought on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some copper wire and <unk> and <unk>
We take a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it together on a light light, and now there's a device that is free -- which is free -- and it builds one, we published the code -- we published the code for free.
And we create a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company to say "No."
There is no hospital that can say "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much to you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this picture is the other person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great <unk>
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of science sessions from all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system in your life and is looking through the support system of his life.
We gave him the bed for you to see it.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot outside of the hospital.
And he got to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to disrupt the parking lot, so we had to be able to <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time I draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to come up and get me out there so that I could get it out.
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it faster and <unk>
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained lots of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, the Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up close the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> in the center of Los Angeles going to be an exhibit called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> in urban art, <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the microphone, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at some time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology I just recognized -- something and <unk> me with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something we feel like we have to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in the last few years in situations generally very difficult and at the same time a lot of dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous mine.
Film in <unk> areas and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating it just -- it's fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous to the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been <unk> in a lot of my career as awful as the only goal to try to examine social issues in ways that <unk> attractive, and hopefully analyzing a way that would be <unk> and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to make a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard of the ear, or not, a couple of weeks ago I took an <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some of the messages on Twitter, I volunteered to sell the name of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company doing it.
But said that, it's a very good opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights on name.
If they had been asked a year ago, I would never have been able to marry certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the marketing world, of <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've gotten in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> nothing could be done for something that was so difficult or as dangerous as you go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> <unk> I want to make a film that tried to <unk> the marketing and the advertising, and that all the film would be <unk> with <unk> of <unk> marketing and <unk>
The movie is going to call "The largest <unk>
What happens in "The biggest movie ever <unk> is that all the top at the bottom -- you have <unk> <unk> all the time from the <unk> shown before the title -- the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's what?
I'm a <unk> <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the brand of the brand X in the title, but we're going to make sure they would take away all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe you pick up a shoe and it becomes the most great shoe that you've got <unk>
The most great car you have led to "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink that you've got <unk> from "The largest <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing you the brands as a part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> MS: And we actually showed the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the <unk> is the transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the shot -- it was all shot from beginning to end.
And I would love to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; that's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> it is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half -- <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to meet with them, but certainly it's going to be worth convincing a couple of big brand.
You know, whoever knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out, we see a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But will be hard to <unk> for the film or for me.
JK: Both of things.
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
And so I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where they go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation <unk>
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to so many people as possible, to make as many people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the stage of the separate media scenario is not the idea to have that new <unk> vehicle that's going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there wasn't such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that showed up.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey Brin: No.
This was the problem: <unk> free simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- the <unk> even the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to reality, it really changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives you --  like that weird bear that is still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare <unk> road.
And it's also very risky.
What else is <unk>
They <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to have <unk> <unk> history.
We want to give them a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would sit in a lie -- and there he was looking at me, as he used to look at me, would say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that only because I met John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go on my own, would have to be taken on my own, would have to be taken off and go to the business of my team.
So what I started to see suddenly -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies that the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who do big, big, huge giants and others that make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood Hollywood movies say that the reason their films are so successful is because of the brands associated with them.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant <unk> <unk>
And the film is called "The largest <unk>
How are we going to see specifically in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want you to help you <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there is one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> from <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man to be <unk> solid, solid to <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the overall end.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
Let's get to the kind of little movies that we <unk> we're more well a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that has new brands.
So doing things like this, you know, remind people about the people is the reason that we think about it.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It is all right.
How do we keep all more time? We get better <unk> more <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of <unk>
I need to talk to the man from the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good <unk>
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something -- <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, a lot of gray colors, so many gray and things like that.
Usually I wear it out as sunglasses, or I like the <unk> and the like.
Woman: If Dan was a brand it could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand of Man 2: I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman #2: partly <unk> partly <unk> partly <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet guy.
They make toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that anything?
<unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be able to do Tom, but I often know myself at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> of <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk>
If they were able to do it for them, they certainly could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way of being.
MS: These <unk> people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think that your world is the world in which the people around us, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case come from, and they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk?
MS: The next is this was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like the different things.
I like weird stuff. I like weird stuff.
A: Tell me about <unk> What is it for us?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find is now?
Why is this important <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
Just a little bit more than you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be scared. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.
A: Thanks for your patience. <unk> Great <unk> Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what it's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness in all of this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides but <unk> in your personality of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only <unk> in one of their strong points or the other instead of focus on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's the <unk> nature of avoiding the things that they're not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements -- and you actually give them something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are that?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful <unk> and <unk> those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS:
If someone asks you to raise your brand, your <unk> <unk> your <unk> what would that be?
You're a <unk> <unk> You're somebody who makes your blood <unk>
Or you're more a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful like being playful like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> <unk> or bold <unk> like <unk> <unk> quick or <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical <unk>
Or are you more of <unk>
You are conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're a <unk> a familiar family -- safe, <unk> <unk> <unk> or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, primarily because they weren't going to be control, they would not have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they now use MRI to identify the <unk> centers in the brain for both commercial marketing and a movie for movies.
We went to San Paulo where they have been forbidden into the open air.
Throughout the city for the last five years there is no <unk> no <unk> no <unk> nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting into schools in schools in the U.S.
The incredible thing to me is that the projects in which I have had the biggest response or the ones that I've been most successful are the ones that I interact with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took off their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to be thinking about people, that will challenge the way we look at the world.
And what has it gone? They did <unk>
Well, since the movie is released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just <unk> no press and press, TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries.
Ultimately, this film has already started to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all the agencies that we talked to her customers is not being part.
I've always believed that if you get <unk> if you take risks, that you have opportunities.
I think when you get out of people that's pushing to failure.
I think when you train your employees at the loss is preparing their whole company for <unk>
I feel that what it has to happen to progress is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities they can afford.
Ultimately, forward, I think we need to give it a place to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk> at risk.
From a <unk> at once, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to park transparency.
And more than a bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk, <unk> <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name on <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So I was Cohen: and then, <unk> in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check to the name of the TED organization, the Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my attendance for next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Its biggest active for developing nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant of <unk> in <unk>
The gray boxes you see are real-time control systems.
If we managed to engage these systems that control <unk> and <unk> we can cause lots of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use software <unk> they're from a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a effective virus of Windows in a laptop using a laptop for an engineer to set up this gray, then we are ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started looking at <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely <unk>
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex on the <unk> <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these systems of control.
That struck us about attention, and we started an experiment where we were going to <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they spent very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat who didn't like our <unk> the wave, the wave, but he didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after I experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for actively in the gray box, if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it is effectively working on that place: <unk>
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because <unk> don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, by example, a plant of the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than the goal is, soon.
And then we pulled out the attack, and we found that I was <unk> in two bombs a small little and a big one.
We also saw that they were armed armed with people who obviously had all the internal information.
It <unk> all the dots that I attack.
You probably even know how much the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard the <unk> <unk> it's complex and high technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this <unk>
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we were looking for in the beginning, were called the system functions because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and structures and tried to <unk> with the real world, with potential targets of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember, it's definitely a violent <unk> must be a <unk> white <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
They're not several thousands of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I met them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the small digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that tiny part of the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow down and <unk> in an obvious way to the <unk> effort to <unk> engineers so that they couldn't solve this very quickly.
We try to figure out the <unk> digital <unk> observing very close to data and its structures.
So for example, the number <unk> shows up in that code, you can't <unk>
I started to investigate scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it was better.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
To not be <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been out after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
Still, we found that both of these digital <unk> were about one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making these <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> of it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry that other targets are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you a very interesting things that we thought, I really <unk>
There's the gray box and the top looks at the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the input values for example, for example, the blood sensors and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the safety camera feeds on video <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
So for example, in a power plant, when the large vapor vapor goes on speed, you have to open tubes from escape from a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do a human operator, of course.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can pass bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And the <unk> and the safety system would be <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or in a factory factory floor.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You can also use conventional technology from <unk> to <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what we <unk> is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we should face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All of the green areas are a large number of goals.
We need to deal with the implications, and better we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has become public in many sides that people assumed that <unk> is the main way behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> <unk>
There is one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in a way, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that you can carry on, and give you the <unk> skills or the other thing that makes food users get up and go back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force, which is also increasing its speed, and for example, for example, to manage balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate it into the universe and with other <unk> things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
In order to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, should take on their back, a burden of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to take even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some complications important -- injuries on their back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage from back.
So we decided to look at this challenge, and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or the <unk> Human Genome <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton -- I can take you 90 kilos on rough terrain for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
So it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of chairs chairs. What I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in roughly, in the world.
Like one percent of the world's population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens to very often, very young people, with the damage to the spinal cord that when they started their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that <unk> quickly.
His only option, a lot of times -- because of a brain injury or some <unk> -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, since its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter of mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had an injury in the <unk> column, and as a result was not able to walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors ...
It was completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals on the computer on board on the back.
There is a batteries in the ground that give energy to the motors in the <unk> and at the knees, and they will move forward with this smooth and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life, when, for a strange jump in the air, skiing costs got <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all of this feeling and all <unk> movement.
Shortly after, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You will never be <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole the last little bit of hope for my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs the <unk> in <unk> climbing rocks and even riding a <unk>
But they've not invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but to Amanda and all the users of chairs with wheels and everybody.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of the rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimps, their closest alive.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known by their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this sort of human evolution of human evolution.
But bonobos show us the other side of the currency.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is an extraordinary land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario that has been lasting for decades, and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also put in danger of the Bonobo.
The trade of beef and deforestation is making you can't fill a stadium with the bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure of it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the laughter hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the ape apes, love, not the <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their whole life.
Play isn't just a game of children.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to establish bonds and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo Bonobo sees the roots <unk> of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual and the <unk>
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple single pair of unique videos taken from the wild.
First, it's a ball of ball <unk> and I don't talk about soccer.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk>
I just believe that in this case he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is common both in Bonobos and in humans.
And this video really is interesting because I <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
<unk> is <unk> it can take many ways some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who's playing with a <unk> <unk>
I think, like her, sometimes we play ourselves, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that propels us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, play is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's get it to the peak of our game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at the least appropriate play, it can be the moments that the most <unk>
So we, in primates, are primates, to embrace this gift of evolution and play together as <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> <unk> as a captain of a captain of the volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers have led to a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the space site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so he had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a race on foot against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I met <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly passed one of the worst days of his life.
We were in the full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just gotten before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  arrived first till the captain came up to the captain and he asked him to go inside and save the dog <unk>
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, he would have to tell the people who entered a building in a building to save a live alive just because I won it for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get between the house.
I need to be able to <unk> the fire, and I bring this woman a pair of shoes."
I promise it.
It wasn't exactly what I was hoping but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the firemen <unk> which at that height or less had been finished on the fire and entered the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> out of the house to the owner of the house where, as he would expect, his treasure. received a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department got a letter from the owner of the <unk> home to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at for the other was that someone had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as a volunteer <unk> I witnessed acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> and courage and individual <unk>
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So, when I look at this room to people who have made it, or are for <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: not wait.
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to giving, <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining hall, <unk> a neighborhood.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So I went to the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This might seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first building blocks of concrete has been built in <unk> with a very simple idea cement from a fixed measure that fits each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building in the world.
They have allowed us to build larger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And within a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to every home.
It's estimated that there are more than 400 billion or 75 miles or 75 bricks for each person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block of the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small little unit of plastic that would take us from a aesthetic <unk> world of each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete, the transistor allows you to create much larger circuits and more complex, a brick at a time.
But there is a <unk> difference. The transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't think about it -- that the building blocks of our time are reserved at experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they're linked by magnets.
So you can't get in the wrong way.
The bricks have a color code.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the <unk> the pink is the input and the orange of color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue blue with a green green and very quickly you can start to make higher circuits.
A blue guy with green you produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, it's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
<unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it <unk> faster or slower, you just tour this button that makes your pulse be faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to <unk> bricks to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand electronics from every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does it work at night, or why is the door to a elevator <unk> or how an iPod responds to touch.
We also have led to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience in electronics start playing with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
So a few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island that you have no experience in engineering, just <unk> wood and paper and said, Do something.
Here's an example of a project that has actually been a canyon <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all of the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world is ours.
So go ahead and make things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my small company is looking to engage with the environment to focus on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> take a moment.
You can take a little bit on <unk>
<unk> we can continue to get the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology technology is ...
Oh, <unk>
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative called <unk> for <unk> and they would be like <unk> <unk>
We had a few members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending it to the Third World -- we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> they worked with the <unk>
Your job is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it shows up as if you look at a date, but what it really looks like is that someone gets to clean up when it gets caught on the snow because he knows it's not very good by putting fires when it's covered by one meter of snow.
How did it come to help such a <unk> way.
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time -- we were going to spend a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens would have <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he puts him <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a component.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 <unk> applications.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads <unk>
One responsible for systems of <unk> City, when you see this application realized that he could use it, not for the snow, but for the citizens to have <unk>
It's very important that these <unk> of tsunami, but people are stealing the batteries.
That's why the citizens <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we have to use it.
And this has spread <unk> in organic and natural way.
If you know a little government technology you know that this doesn't normally happen.
<unk> acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best school for their children.
Then they told us that they had done the normal channels would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the Gulf of California that until time two million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that is program in a couple of days and it's <unk> a little kind of warning <unk> to the institution of government.
It suggests to the best ways to work, not as in private private companies, like a lot of people think that should be.
Nor also as a technological company, but more well as the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to tackle the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution that is <unk> but as a collective action problem.
And that's really good because it turns out we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people that are building the tools so that they would adapt together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> <unk> every day in their own communities.
They're not given up to the government.
Do you feel a big frustration to that but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something we've lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, you line up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that put us crazy -- the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together is because we alone don't <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics isn't <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately made us -- remember that <unk> -- the way of thinking about it will affect the way that we can produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to <unk> <unk>
Well, after two years, I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the health care center.
It's the place that calls the calls if you brand <unk> in America.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the basis of official knowledge.
I didn't find nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, putting music very hard and see if you <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a <unk> web and mobile, called <unk> <unk>
You don't want that application.
It was the work of people from the Bureau of New <unk> <unk>
One day, this actually happened this <unk> <unk> in my <unk> I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The <unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I approached the place, I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good evening.
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of government income to criminal volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to <unk> and help others.
Then a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
We connected two people.
And it could have connected with the government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When one neighbor helps each other, <unk> communities.
If we call animal control, that's a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people are <unk> but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our input system is your vote.
How many times have you chosen a <unk> leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy in order to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government <unk> our values and <unk> our needs and then we don't see changes.
That is because the government is like a huge ocean and politics is the shallow <unk>
It's below what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> what it holds us from that is that we funded as something that is working on against the other thing, and in a consequence we're losing power.
People think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work -- we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real job of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report for 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not <unk> political activism.
And for the ones that we've been dealing with the government, it's time that we ask ourselves, what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see massive challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe where we need to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do <unk> we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to root the root function of the government function so it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that hard to act -- you only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The age of the age of our members is 28 years old, so I -- to <unk> I'm a larger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face on who is going to <unk> they're all going to speak.
They can express your opinions on any channel at the same time.
So when the government problem is, they don't really care about making your voices.
They're using your hands.
They make the work in the work to program application to work better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
We were always able to have cleaned those <unk> and many people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that, we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until they didn't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all of us will be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a crowd of the hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in communities that have been involved in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things that I noticed in this short time is that TED has an identity.
And the things that are telling you here have impact all over the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that would never have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic PowerPoint PowerPoint here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling you can have special meaning in it.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can do much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the right, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a family <unk> dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in all of the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery and <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was tough but it was also <unk>
When I was small and looked at her, she was approaching me and I was getting a good <unk>
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk> me.
One or two hours later, I would go back to <unk> I was approaching me and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he said no, I would go back again and if I said yes, I was leaving in peace.
I had this human quality that would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went into the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At the beginning I thought it was a game.
So I looked at her and I was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, went and went and went up, took me out of my hand, and he said, "Come on."
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me out and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you to <unk>
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't know, I said, "Sure."
And then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "Just want me to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "I first I want you to ask me, is you always want your mother."
I said, "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
Like I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to do, is that you will always be the right thing even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought I was like, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then, finally he said, "I know the third thing I want you to do is that I would never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in <unk> <unk> I have a brother a year older and a sister a year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and myself and went to the forest.
We just got to do the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, he took my sister, she took a little bit and was offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> <unk> And you always do the same thing as we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
I landed on the hand with force and <unk> "Oh, it's not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells you all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I am 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a <unk> I say it by the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things that they really don't make sense.
We can't get them to do things that they don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that every grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related <unk>
And these were the things that we had to do with it, as we had to <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different from what it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate of <unk>
We have seven million people in freedom.
And this massive <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, poor communities, is so much <unk> as much despair, determined by these facts.
One in three black girls between 18 and 30 years is in jail or <unk>
In urban <unk> around the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore in 50 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to the parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, also it's about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that makes you much better if you're rich and <unk> than if you're poor, innocent and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results of the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these aren't problems with ours.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work a few different developments here.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as other states, you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black population has lost the right to vote.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before we had the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it was about 13 years sentence to die in prison.
We have this country in jail for children, not to get out of it.
Right now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people at death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in some sense, we have been able to think that the ultimate question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
Very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for the crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death is defined by error.
In every nine people <unk> you've identified an innocent people, who is innocent and liberated from the death row.
<unk> <unk> <unk> an innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not allow you to never fly airplanes if every nine to <unk> you would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on <unk> history, I talk about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time that began at the end of the rebuilding and that took to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a time defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried to be <unk>
The terror threat was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come up with me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach talks, you teach people to stop saying that in our history we deal with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> <unk> we grew up with that."
The era of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of racial and <unk> and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time <unk> each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death row.
It was fascinating, because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's very disturbing to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> in Germany.
<unk> will never be able to have to be here."
The room stayed quiet and a lady said, "There's no way that with our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> <unk> and <unk> we would put people to <unk>
<unk> about this.
How would we sit in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you don't really care about these hard issues, the positive and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. It is creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, these realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my mind, we need to integrate both of these things.
lately we talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means to spend more time thinking about and talking about the poor, <unk> which will never come to TED.
If you think about it is, in a way, something that is inside of us.
It's true that we have to believe that we haven't seen it.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to intellectual <unk>
The development with innovation, development comes not just of brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also from the <unk>
This connection from the heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope for spirit, a will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no <unk> related to technology and design, which allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we <unk> these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege to be a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, lady lady -- I called it to be called to go, <unk> she comes to me to talk about it.
Do you want to come and <unk>
He said, "Be lady. I do."
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was just going to be the <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion was there listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks was headed to me and said, "Now, <unk> I'm a little bit of that idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving it my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been <unk>
We are trying to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce the population in prison.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech and the end he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> <unk> put me my finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to figure out how to deal with those challenges, those issues, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in things.
I have come to understand and to believe that each one of us is higher than the worst thing we have ever <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not that it's a <unk>
Even if someone kills each other, it's not to be a <unk>
So this is why I think there is basic dignity in the people who have to be killed by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's right.
I really think that in many parts of the opposite of poverty is the justice.
And finally, I think it's very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> we won't judge our technology, for our designs, nor for our intellectual or rational.
At the end of the <unk> the character of a society, not because of the way we treat rich and powerful, but as they treat the poor, they <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a very important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my customers of 13 and 14 years, who have been <unk> so that they were <unk> as adults are going to be.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to someone who is not it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night too late he was awake -- my God, if the judge can become something that you don't are, you have to have magical <unk>
Yes, <unk> the judge has <unk> powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> customer <unk> <unk> black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> saying, <unk> so that my <unk> black client was treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> I put there were there that there were been <unk> behavior in the <unk> behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line, about how in this country there is no ethical -- it's a lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had <unk> but he had sent it to the court.
It took about two months, I have forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to the cut for this stupid.
I got up to the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got down the car. She walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met with a black man, was the <unk> of the courthouse.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
So I got approached and <unk>
And I <unk> in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you that that was <unk>
That connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the workplace.
When I arrived, the judge looked at me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> I said. And we started scribbling.
People started to go. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They came up with the <unk> prosecutors <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, and we were talking about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I noticed the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I would look out the window, and you will hear all that <unk>
You walk around here and over there.
Finally, this old black man, with a <unk> face in the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break, a <unk> assistant <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
He walked across the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> to this audience room to tell this young man to keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I have come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
That we can't be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is connected to the other people.
That our visions of technology, design and creativity must lead to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of the people in the room who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire to the audience, in this community, to help in your own, to do something.
Something that is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to that.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to make an effort to <unk> the funding that you spend today in punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of <unk> cases of homicide is not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get nowhere.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are <unk> these funds to make the law <unk>
I think there's a very <unk> opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, is that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe this?
<unk> Actually, the death rate has remained relatively stable.
The large growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war on Drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let ourselves convince us for the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes. We have three legal causes to bring people into a chain -- they would pay for stealing a bicycle, for small crimes against property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> <unk> you have been excited about today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- could be over the last six days or for the last six years.
The idea is that media means rather <unk> negative news, because our minds are paying attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses get a lot of more data than the brain probably can be <unk>
And as nothing matters to us to survive, the first stop of all of this data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could cause damage.
So by a <unk> of stories -- to look at the <unk>
That old saying from <unk> "If there's blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of a week, 24 hours a day, it's not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going wrong on worse.
But maybe not that way.
Maybe, instead what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the <unk> of the species, the scarcity of <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long run, we ended up with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita income.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, for electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy is 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we keep <unk> expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, most of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water <unk> cell conditioning <unk> air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
You know, a lot of this is the technology and then lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> into information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price performance in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It is Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad days, in war and peace, in the <unk> in <unk> and <unk>
It's the end of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it gets <unk>
The growth rate is actually faster and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing, and sensors and networks, 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized capacity and all the planet, the synthetic biology, the vaccines, the vaccines, and the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory in <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was <unk>
I sought the newspapers the best headline to <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and, in particular, how can they be used to solve the biggest challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can really affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have a <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have been done.
When I think about creating plenty, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each inhabitant on the planet, it's about creating a life of how you can.
It's about taking that stuff that's <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, the scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that frees resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
They <unk> the king of <unk>
The troops from Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most precious metal on the planet, it was almost more than gold and <unk>
So the end of the <unk> to Washington is aluminum
You see, even though the aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like <unk>
It's tied up with oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum something so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
We put this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that's going to be <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about <unk> it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated of the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. <unk> parts of America, electricity will cost six cents per hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have energy abundance we also have water abundance as well.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager <unk> spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, then <unk>
I was looking at a famous picture, how do you <unk>
"A pale <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent per water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, two percent ice is ice, and we fought for the world's water <unk> but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes from nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> her technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water on the day of any <unk> <unk> water <unk> a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought that will make a major test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes right, and I have full confidence in that way, Coca-Cola will actually implement it in the world in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an <unk> innovation, for this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent <unk> in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior warrior has better mobile communications <unk> in the middle of Kenya than the president Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smart smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than the Clinton President 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have happened.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> video books and music technology, diagnostic technology -- now <unk> and lose value value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get to look at the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the world's teams to make these technologies in a mobile device with which they speak, and because it has <unk> they can be able to get <unk>
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a <unk> medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there is no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are health care workers.
When this device <unk> an RNA virus or DNA that is not going to call the health <unk> and first of all, let me stop the epidemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of plenty.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of 7 billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, through two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds have never been given to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you do? What <unk> <unk>
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the greatest economic injection in history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy -- and because of the use of 3D impressions and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can that provide three billion of human beings -- healthy and <unk>
How about voices have never been <unk>
What if we give them to the headlights wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act by the first time?
What would these 3,000 <unk>
And if they are contributions we can't afford to.
One thing I learned with the X X is that small teams guided by his passion with a goal of course, you can do things -- things that had only been able to do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really <unk> me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein.
And the folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They've played with this college professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came together and started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better -- folding proteins than better computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge confidence in the future is that today we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovator in the <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are <unk> us to work on the solution of major challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute before it will give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that they were <unk> but not that way.
It's actually <unk> fish.
And it described to one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish are in the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a <unk> in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The <unk> was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from <unk>
There were <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And fishing in this <unk> was very abundant and passed on for a good moment, so he was made out of the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
<unk> at the age of <unk>
We put a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In some ways, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, <unk> started in the <unk> Europe, he did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was to impose countries that had 100,000 <unk> <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty <unk> called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish in him, and we did studies in the South China Sea <unk> and, above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
<unk> now I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are on the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny little <unk> about <unk> remains <unk>
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you make a studio and then start the commercial fishing.
The bottom of being a solid coral of the soft coral in this case is a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Don't the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We had once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains what the fishermen collect every time they go to an area that they have never seafood.
But there was no <unk>
We <unk> the world, but we don't remember.
They <unk> the beginning point to start to the new level, without remembering what was there.
So if you <unk> this happens something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, amount of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the <unk>
And then at the end of keeping some <unk> <unk>
And that, in large measure, we want to do now.
We want to keep the things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when Western societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose <unk> animals.
Even if this isn't perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on large animals, and in a synonymous sea of large fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time, they have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the way they would expect evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as a captain as a captain as I looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used in this area can't be used or, usually they don't use the scientists of <unk> because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't trust the sources of the past.
Hence the enormous role that you can fulfill a protected marine area.
Because with the marine areas, we really <unk> the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has been run and extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine zone, and they can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the Middle East, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may be able to fill the vacuum.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
It was a long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay.
And you might have noticed the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were touched with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do they <unk> with <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only to giving, is to Cameron, I <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why the videos are made viral and what important it does have that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk>
But today the web video makes any of us, or our copper <unk> copper in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be made famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They get over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a small percentage goes viral, gets countless views and makes a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and the surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views on the <unk> rise of last summer.
<unk> was not meant to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called the <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this <unk> who <unk> the video to the popular.
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> are presented with new and interesting things and <unk> them into a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.   Everyone wants you to come up for a week, the weekend.    You know, Friday. You will have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this <unk>
Well, I took a lot of blogs -- and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science -- was one of the first people to do a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or an creators of trends will have a point of view and share it with a broader audience and accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this great <unk> and then starts talking about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century entertainment of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon of <unk> or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation, with a <unk> music.
That's so, that's it.
This year saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a three hours that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity I woke up with between the <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Someone made a version at the old one.
And then an international <unk>
All of a sudden, this whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all become part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or <unk> Black or <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written to <unk>
In a world where two days of video goes up two days of video per minute, just that really unique and unexpected can <unk> the way these things have been done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy that <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't really interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> on the <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you properly <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and the surprise and their humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million to see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing that we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads us to a big question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of <unk> creative communities, participation, fully unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media -- that we all have access to and is the audience that defines the popularity of the public.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities <unk> Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They didn't get permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- they're just the media of today's media, but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had totally been in vain.
The words, for so long, my friends, now I <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died <unk> in history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but I <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> towards the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old, when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined to <unk> the escape from her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> which is a boat fiction, a boat slid into the sea dressed in <unk>
Every adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear of the <unk> the rape and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we were <unk> we would first take it my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast and vacuum.
I don't remember the pirates who came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men on our boat, or the motor dying and not being able to start by six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man that collapsed and died, finish the journey was too much to it; and the first apple I did, given by the <unk>
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women along three generations making a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of class, whose population is made of immigrant <unk>
Unlike the suburbs of middle class -- whose existence I <unk> in <unk> no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the <unk> fragments -- <unk> between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a line of car <unk> working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, wouldn't mind what was supposed to be <unk> which was usually <unk> was always <unk>
Two pairs of middle for school, one to hide holes in the other.
A school uniform until the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back house."
<unk> where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares were to be able to <unk>
She opened up a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the mad and <unk> and <unk> kids caught between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the student <unk> classical student with what I was talking about myself.
On the other, it was <unk> in <unk> <unk> tragically violence, drug abuse and <unk>
But many of them received help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer -- I was elected the young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges don't <unk>
<unk> <unk> resident was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited me to speak in sites that I had never heard about, and in houses whose existence had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the happy life in a <unk> suburb -- one grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of every single <unk>
And I told my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got the boat.
<unk> had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What don't you <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking about, the more it was to talk to me to speak.
I met people from all the roads in life, a lot of them doing what they were doing, living on the border of the possible.
And even though I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time it's okay to be a stranger, a newly <unk> new thing on the scene -- and not just it's fine, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> were <unk>
There was an energy there, a <unk> optimism -- some <unk> and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
It was going to be a small group of people who <unk> <unk> <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we had no <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant <unk> of soup that all <unk>
They went up to a very good entry at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant, and we opened up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
after one trip.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had no longer changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
<unk> became a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of his husband, he caused a <unk> to <unk> and bring the cause she did, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
The cannot act proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the hotel room in Sydney when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw her standing on the other side.
I knew I'd come to <unk>
My mother called a minutes later.
Days later, later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night, a <unk> came and told us he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise his hand.
And I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"Don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Given who we were and how life built us, we can now see that the men that would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would have <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could look like that to you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, a brave to each wave, the <unk> pace the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to a little bit, it would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this today -- in the fourth or a fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing changed since the time of the former Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I <unk> the great Prince warrior Indian he was <unk> he took a bow and a <unk> on the floor, could get water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we got was the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was very much fun to me.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I <unk> this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't help my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic, not <unk>
As my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this piece of 50 years was for my most magic.
He became a golden door to a world full of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them down.
<unk> our inspiration.
And so I <unk> myself to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
I <unk> books since the age of 16,
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a <unk> device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how to take the book out.
Where we are.
We put the text up with the image, the animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes more and more <unk>
But what is that for us?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each other.
And so ...   He says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In a few times I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes led to me.
My inner girl is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that I <unk> children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar would always become exciting to me.
So over here, we have to change the iPad for releasing fireflies.
And actually they shine your way into the way that the rest of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by that was a little girl in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every book of fantasy has always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another hugely important thing for me is to create Indian content and contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts -- <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old <unk> <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's history of <unk>
In a story that involves current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> have not come out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can get our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this journey where you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So in order to get this childhood ritual -- you have to go out and, in a chapter, I would take a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of <unk> and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of pictures that you can then put on the Web.
A little boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
And within the different variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology are there many possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction where you go out with the iPad, and the video goes on and through actually augmented reality -- you see a group of animated <unk> that appear on the inner plants of the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves with leaves here.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We go into a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology and technology are present to another one.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University <unk> was <unk> a director of the listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and I asked patients, family and <unk> What do you <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a sandwich and it goes on and shut down.
Every morning I <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I set up the challenge of getting to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time when it needs to be <unk> or any urgency of that style -- but I would see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's the pressure of the base used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for the patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From next week to be available from the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were <unk> from their homes, to take their blood pressure, <unk> to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, return to <unk> control and become captains of their own <unk> but they can also help us care about health care because of the challenges that we face as the firing of the costs of attention, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share with you with a video of you.
We all have <unk> controls in <unk>
We maybe even have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where the <unk> ATM <unk>
Also where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food <unk>
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we did <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to <unk> you see a <unk> please say, <unk> where, and when it's open, they have sometimes open in a <unk> and others are closed.
And more than 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to search for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> they can use their iPhone, and the next few weeks to use their cell phone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we wish to <unk> globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that they will help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
You could be <unk> services or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> which is still in their place.
Please <unk> in this and not just improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest for photography was woke up with my first digital camera at age 15.
I mixed with my <unk> passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera the process was in the planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anyone could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite that, he holds a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful pictures to the time, but with the common goal to keep the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I mean <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way as photography.
So let's think that you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem <unk>
They're the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think it's realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality in which we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some way you can create something that still looks like <unk> as if you exist.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's take the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really to combine different <unk>
And the things that make a picture seem realistic -- I think that they're not even <unk> things around us in our daily lives.
But by combining photographs it's very important to <unk> because otherwise something will look wrong.
So I would like to say there are three simple rules that will go on to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures -- they must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> were taken on the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of different places.
In the personal -- I think it's easier to create a place that you'll find out because you don't need to get in danger the ideas that have on your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a <unk>
And I know, even <unk> the house of the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome, I think it takes planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
And then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and it's very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide on technology, very boring.
Please can you <unk>
It's a diagram anybody who took from a manila folder,
I'm not interested in showing you the details, but the general thing.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many of the other we usually see, is kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk>
Here's something strange.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing on paper.
Why do we have technological curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if I draw them in a normal curve in which, say, these are the years or some unit of time, and this would be any kind of time of the technology that I'd like to <unk> the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you <unk> for example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very <unk> we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> shift.
If the technology of the transport technology will be as quickly as <unk> past tomorrow we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But we don't go through that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of the technological development of <unk> growth, that every few years will advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- looking at these <unk> <unk> we see they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
It <unk> one of two things.
Or it's okay to become a typical curve, I know like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe going to happen something like that.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what the world used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, what is that new way <unk>
Where else is the world?
The transition looks very, very <unk> if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future of the future in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future remains 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
And we can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that transition to be that <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at the long term.
The scale of time that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we looked at every billion years.
So you go back about a half a half half a billion years when the Earth was a large <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that would <unk> around them.
If we look at the way that we organized those chemicals we give us a sense of how things happen.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, I had floating on a <unk> of oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside it.
Some of those droplets of oil had had a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring up materials from the outside and so the droplets grew up grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those oil.
But those droplets weren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> they would get a distribution of the chemicals that they <unk>
So every single <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow are <unk> to be better at the time to bring chemical chemicals in, more <unk> more chemicals and become more <unk>
They usually live longer. They were more <unk>
It was a way of life, living chemistry, very simple, but things got interesting to be interesting when these droplets learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to store information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, it will be <unk> in this meaningless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were to record them from what they were in order to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since a half two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
So here I have 100 <unk> dust that I try to hide the airport security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If I was a <unk> it would have put it on a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells quite happy about another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things were <unk> very different and that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming as well as cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, we have antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place that would be able to make communities that, in some ways, were together with it, and a <unk>
In that <unk> mode, or <unk> it together, or if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community were <unk> more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the turning point happened when these communities came so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe in the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life led to another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities, <unk> communities, many different types of cells working together as one organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that no longer act alone.
The skin cell doesn't use the heart of the heart, or your muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and were more interesting levels than cell phone, which we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they did not even more than process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that these mobile cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So a organism, for example, learn to not eat certain fruit because he knew bad and got sick last time they ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had previously built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system would build these heavy data structures enormously the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the communications trick.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If you think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea an idea in the head.
I'm sitting here emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea -- <unk> <unk> in their heads that holds some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated -- we convert it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to do <unk>
We now go through periods of similar periods of <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods and information processing and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The computer <unk> the computer tape, the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to manage that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen at microseconds.
They already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where I produced certain evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated at the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that I told you was carrying a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
<unk> the language, and they took less than a million years.
And each other, like electronics, it looks like a few decades.
The process <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that speeds up its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I get my life to design computers, and I know that the mechanisms that job for <unk> would not be possible without the recent advances in recent years.
But now design objects of such a complexity that would be impossible for me to <unk> in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that you didn't could, gets much further away and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes they use methods that we don't even understand.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using recently is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
And we say, "Please run a hundred million instructions from instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, to run all those programs, and take those more than <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to <unk> numbers to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely to be some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences better than the <unk>
They <unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now I <unk> the ones that would better <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> kids, who <unk> <unk> and that the children will <unk> the properties of both companies.
So we get a new generation of software combinations that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
And we have a few mutations ...
and he tries to go again and do it with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in a complicated, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs, I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze it to see how they work.
They're dark <unk>
But they have the <unk>
In fact, I have the safety of the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage to hundreds of thousands of programs that we had to.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
I once went on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he got a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> the airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a <unk> flight -- doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so that we can run these programs much faster quickly.
I mean, they were <unk>
The thing is getting faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant about our thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is to come.
But now comes the lunch and I think stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time for letting me give up some of my fake fake <unk>
Before I treat my talk, talk about a little baseball.
Why not?
We are close to the end, this is the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
<unk> is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
You know, it's because of <unk> <unk> speaks about statistics and use them to form a great baseball.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we're talking about 300 percent of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means that the bat <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball into the game of play without being <unk> and that anyone who's trying to get to the first base of it, don't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three attempts at 10.
You know what they call a <unk> of 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, actually, maybe the team of the stars.
You know what they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody who in 10 <unk> gets four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player at the <unk> League of <unk> to run more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now I think about this to my medical world where I feel much more comfortable, or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're derivatives of a surgeon who has also a record for 400 to <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose you live in a place away and a dear self has two <unk> <unk> and their family physician brings it to a cardiologist whose family record is <unk>
But do you know what?
She is getting a lot of better this year.
And their hits and their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But what would you do?
What do you think should be the average of hits from a heart surgeon or a nurse from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very good.
And the truth of the matter is that nobody in the whole medicine knows the hits from a good surgeon, of a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, though, is sending me to the world, and I would say to myself, with the mandate of being perfect.
I would never, ever make a mistake and try and figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I did when I was in medical school.
I was a obsessional student, <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs was a blood test.
Such which.
<unk> in my little <unk> the nurses of the General <unk> <unk> not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my class of anatomy, the origin and labor -- the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And they even knew the differential diagnosis of how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the school in medicine with the impression that if you would take everything, then would it know everything, or as possible, close to everything, because so I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when brought to the lady with the emergency service where I worked.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I was trying to go to a cardiologist to a cardiologist I was going to go to this patient.
And they report the chief of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> she was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which was <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of pump your blood forward, the blood goes on to our lungs, and these are <unk> of blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I read about.
I gave him <unk> and medication to relieve pressure on your heart.
I gave him <unk> <unk> so that it could actually eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I felt great.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more errors.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get the phone and did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
I probably didn't want to be a resident who would make constant care.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send her home, I didn't take care of a voice in my inner house that would say, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't you <unk>
In fact, I was so sure that until he asked the nurse to <unk> Mrs. <unk> "Do you think it's okay if he goes to her <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said, <unk> <unk> "Yeah, I think being okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high school, and the ambulance together with the <unk> they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in your stomach.
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I <unk> to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot, where I was my car to go home. And at that moment I did something I didn't do normally, normally, I did something I don't do normally,
I went through the emergency service service to home.
And there was another nurse, not that she was <unk> from Mrs. <unk> before, but another words, he told me three words, those three words that most doctors in emergency emergency.
Other specialists are afraid of people too, but there is a <unk> in <unk> and is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: don't you?
<unk> of the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
So, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
After an hour of having come to his house, after I gave her high school, he suffered a high collapse and her family called the <unk> the <unk> the emergency room with a lower blood pressure, which means a shock severe.
I was just breathing and it was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all their resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> it was in intensive care, and he was waiting for all hope that <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that they never <unk>
It had a <unk> brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they went to what was going on.
And in ninth day, she left go. She was <unk> and wife, and mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of the people who die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks later, I was excited about it and experienced for the first time, the shame shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat down alone, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't afford it with your colleagues.
You make peace and never more makes that mistake.
It's that shame that makes a teaching.
Shame is <unk> that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that <unk>
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I would go through the stuff and made sure that I didn't care about it.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he sent to your home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose <unk>
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And in a day he was opened up the sky and finally came out, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if I was going to deal with the efforts to be perfect not to make more errors, would make away those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back again.
Two years later, I was an <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital in northern Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into his throat, I was a little <unk>
He sent him penicillin in his home.
But as he ran to the door he was following his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my head <unk> my boss asked me to talk to me in his office.
And I made the three words: Do you remember you?
Remember the patient who saw in the <unk>
So he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can Google Google -- it's an infection, not the throat, but from the upper area, and that can cause the closing of those tracks.
He said, fortunately, she didn't die.
They are <unk> antibiotics a <unk> <unk>
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back to work, and I went back to work, until it happened again and again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> at 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> <unk>
I <unk> a kidneys of kidneys -- but it turned out normal. A colleague who was checking the patient <unk> some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner and called a surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it up, and when you notice some sensitivity in the bottom right right right, I called the surgeon.
Both were operated and spontaneously recovered well.
But every single case <unk> me <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and like a lot of colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most meaningful have been for the last five years.
I'm embarrassed and no support.
And here's the problem: if I can't help myself and talk about my mistakes if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so they don't make the same <unk>
If I entered a place like this, I had no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you're not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, that a <unk> in my hospital -- the wrong leg, believe it would have a hard time in looking at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the ones that fear that they can't sleep and the ones that I know; those who have <unk> results and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, as antibodies that you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get rid of medicine to the people who make errors, will be a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and medical journalism, I've made a personal personal study of medical litigation and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Toronto <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes are going on every day, where one in 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where <unk> infections are increasingly <unk> and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die <unk> <unk> medical <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they're things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is divided every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to do a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest chest <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't <unk> their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we were <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals -- well, not to be no one.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their most <unk> cases.
In my <unk> white, <unk> art, it's a habit of saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the <unk> to the head of <unk> surgery, this is my worst <unk> and <unk> the microphone to them.
And their students were <unk> to go down and go down and get them down, saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human, you know human <unk> they accept it, but they're not proud of their mistakes, but he tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They <unk> their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and support for everybody to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes rather than time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel a lot but I really strive to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember.
You know how many decisions we take a <unk> day.
You know how much we choose in a week?
Recently I did a survey for more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that says to pick an average American. It's about 70 percent.
Not a lot of time ago in a research followed for a week to a group of presidents companies.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks for these executives and the time they were planning to make related decisions with those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> a week.
Naturally, every job involved a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine or less.
Only 12 percent required one hour or more of their time.
Now think about your elections.
Do you know how many of you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do they pinpoint how they serve those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know how to know their answers.
When I ask a question, I am blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, I <unk> this <unk> supermarket.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the <unk> water, and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was like, why did I never buy anything?
This is a shelf oil shelf <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes -- including the ones that were in <unk> box that came from <unk> trees.
Once I decided to go to the manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists which came every day, usually with its cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of things.
I had a <unk> put to the entrance to the store.
We put up there <unk> from six <unk> or 24 flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> up to 60 than when there were only six, about 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
Of the ones that stopped when there were only three percent came to buy <unk>
From those who stood up when there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, deciding we don't buy <unk> probably <unk> <unk> less is good to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices is affecting us in good <unk>
We decided to not decide, even when this doesn't get <unk>
Now the subject of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I made with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from between a million Americans, from this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of <unk> funds available for retirement, <unk> program <unk> people to save the future.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the greater was the number of funding number there were less participation.
So if you look at the extreme ends, we see that in the plans that provide two funds, the rate of participation were 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation went to the <unk>
It turns out, even if you decide to participate, when there are more choices, even in that case, there are unintended consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the greater the number of options, more people are <unk> to avoid the actions or hedge funds.
As a more choice, they were more willing to invest in consumer financial states.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three negative negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities.
What's most likely to do is that <unk> the decision, that <unk> even when it goes against the self-interest.
They are more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick up less <unk> even though objectively you objectively it better.
The main reason is that we will be able to look at that huge variety of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for a contrast and to choose that amazing <unk>
I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so they can test it in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more than today, less than more.
People are always touched when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But what we're seeing is what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut, get rid of the strange choices -- they will have an increase on sales, <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden <unk> <unk> I eliminated the products for <unk> and <unk> <unk> that were less <unk> the <unk> in <unk> for two <unk> plus sales and lower costs.
You know that today's retail supermarkets are known to offer 45,000 products.
In a grocery store there's about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world today is <unk> and there was just 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce sauce <unk>
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have come out of how to handle the choices is the software.
Every Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a safe background of life.
Those who really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these choices are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are among those options.
And if your employees cannot <unk> you can't do it either.
This evening, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people from this audience on a holiday with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave you for a few seconds to <unk> and then I want to give you a round of applause. If you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> <unk> All right. Anybody who is ready to accept the supply.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a <unk>
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually raised more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first <unk> than in the second trial, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the skill <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete,
Why do people spend 15 percent more on average when they use credit card cards or credit than when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't look real money.
It turns out to make it much more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more people to get them out of them.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked on <unk> these people were in a meeting that were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And at that meeting that we were looking at as a little <unk> we did a little <unk>
So what we added was that we would get the staff to think of the positive things that they would have in their lives if they save more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent and an increase in how many people were interested in saving or what they wanted to place in their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a <unk>
We saw that in <unk> supermarket supermarkets throughout the <unk> <unk> exhibition can contain from <unk> different types of different kinds of <unk> to <unk>
But, you know?
Because the <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two sets of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> Give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there are some of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> Give a <unk>
Well, something else.
Turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This <unk> scheme is totally useless.
<unk> must tell us something that we <unk> not when they <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge <unk>
I am supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out we can handle a lot more information than what we think about -- if just <unk> a little bit.
We have to increase technological complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision -- it buys you a car.
This is a German car manufacturer that enables you to <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to put up the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
<unk> color from the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order where the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from many options, 56 colors, just about four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from few options, four <unk> to 56 colors, so many options.
And what am I going to do here?
How much you are.
If you <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from a lot of options, <unk> the <unk> button over and over again, and another one.
I <unk>
If you go from few choices to many, they go there.
The same information, the same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order of the information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though the choice of change doesn't tell you about the preferences of <unk> interior, in all ways we would make us a choice.
We are excited about a product that we're building now has more <unk> with the process.
So let's sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've been presented were designed to help drive the <unk> or better, for you, to use them on their own business, or for people who work on.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful about the <unk>
And the more we are in our choices to be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1950s years, in Indian East Germany -- if you had a typewriter should be <unk> in the government.
You had to register a piece of text text on the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West -- we don't think that someone could do this, how much it would bring the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having a few yellow print on each page that follows a pattern that makes you and your printer.
That is happening today.
And nobody looks like a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the Web.
If we look at what's happening in the online world, we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
Are the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to make a lot of money, huge amounts of it.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that would raise money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew <unk> <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media by using banking to steal money from our accounts when we bought in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought into a <unk> computer.
The American secret service, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account.
Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be any of us to be a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going wrong on worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves, they give them the protests, you motivate the views, you motivate your laughs to motivate them.
<unk> as Anonymous has <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> <unk> criminals that do it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous that do they do to protest and the last group are the national United States.
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government <unk>
<unk> is an <unk> authority of the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
They <unk> the safety of the site and carried out a <unk>
Last week I asked, at a meeting with the Dutch government representative of Dutch government asked one of the leaders if you <unk> <unk> the death of people who have the attack on <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from a attack on these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except to <unk> a foreign authority.
And they were going to lead <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters called the Norwegian secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those roles was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder, there were notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a huge scale of the communication of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 300,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools they provide tools to <unk> governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, he found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officials to research their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case -- well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
It <unk> the Internet connection,
We have even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think closely about things like these the obvious answer should be like, "Well, it looks like something bad, but it actually doesn't affect me, because I'm an honest citizen.
Why is it <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If you could well trust our governments today in 2011, any right you will think about today will be forever.
We're blindly blindly <unk> in a management that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that should be worried about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the south of National Park in Nairobi.
These are the cows of my father, at the bottom, and behind the cows, National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park New Nairobi has no fences in the highest of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
We <unk> our cattle.
This is one of the people who killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and found it dead I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and that's why we value it.
So I grew up with a lot of lions.
They were people dying that they protect our community and livestock and livestock and they're also <unk> with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, at age six to nine years is responsible for her father's livestock and this was the same thing that I was going to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were scared.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because even helping lions see the pen away.
I didn't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick lions so they believed that he was near the <unk>
But lions are really smart.  They came the first day and watched the <unk> and they were told, but the second day, came back and they said, this thing doesn't always move, it's always here.  So he went and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions did not.
I discovered that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that you turn on and turn off the lights.
And this is a little <unk> of a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell hit the battery and the battery would take electricity into the little box, and I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights off.
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where lions.
And this is how you see the lions when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago and since then, we never went back to have problems with lions.
And the neighborhood houses, you heard the idea.
One is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked if I could put the lights up.
I said yes.
The <unk> You can see the background, these are the lights to lions.
Since then, I have installed in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot of it.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, to <unk> other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also being used for elephants to farms.
Thank you to this invention, I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, International <unk> and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds, and <unk>
I even took my friends into my community and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a little boy in the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see flying airplanes and he said it would someday be within one.
And today I am.
I got a chance to come in airplane for the first time at TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like you.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make an electric <unk> CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know that they were invented <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: You know, I read it once, right?
We're going to <unk> in every step that you have a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> history, but we never learned much from the rest of the world, except for America, South Korea, Japan is the enemies.
But sometimes I asked myself about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public performance.
But I thought that my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That he said, "When you know, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten it in the last two weeks.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, that we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard people suffering from my country.
At a short time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't delete my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child <unk> in her arms looking at his mother's face without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about them and their families.
An enormous famine left North Korea to the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They were also made more and more rare -- the power of energy, all around me was completely dark at night except for the lights of the sea in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite photo of North Korea in the night compared to the countries compared to the countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is the limits between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only tell you that for the year of starvation I was sent to China to live with <unk> parents.
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years back to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult but dangerous -- because the refugees in North America were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was done when I was arrested for the Chinese police and I was <unk> at the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum <unk>
But many people can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although the <unk> had eventually been released after an international international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
But I was lucky enough to <unk> many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragedy that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding jobs -- all of its world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why 10 years to hide my identity, I've decided to be going to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and south.
We're all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different from 67 years of <unk>
Even through an identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call with my pride with me.
Even though I went to the life in South Korea it wasn't easy -- I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authority <unk> some money that I sent to my family, and as <unk> my family was going to be shifted to the force to a role in the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way towards freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea, in the South Africa.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to <unk> in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost trapped several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and visited by a police officer.
He asked the <unk> of all of them and started asking them.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> and I told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
He looked at me <unk> but fortunately, I believed it.
We did all the way down to the <unk> border.
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe the border <unk> in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released by a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did all of us free to my family, and we were so close to myself, but my family was <unk> in prison at a short distance of the embassy embassy <unk>
I was going to go out between the <unk> office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary I explained to him, and I explained the situation, the man was the <unk> <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for some other North Koreans and take them out of prison.
I <unk> with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why did I get <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, a new hope for me and for the <unk> people, when I was <unk>
And he showed me that the kindness of strangers and support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea, in South Africa.
But the freedom is only half of the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they <unk> a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language practices work, and more.
We also can act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans <unk> around the world, including the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in a South <unk>
This is <unk> Center.
So the city planners come together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of Southern <unk> so it represents something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles -- as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South <unk>
Just like <unk> million other Americans, live in a food <unk> Los Angeles Center, South Africa -- the home of food places to take and eat in the car.
Curious thing is that food places to bring more people out of food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in the South Pole.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times older than say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I was telling you that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of your house you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see chairs of wheels and sold like <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have <unk>
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 feet by three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
That's how I decided to keep it going.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we get together and we started to plant our food forest -- trees -- <unk> trees -- you know, the nine <unk>
What we do, we are a kind of paid <unk> group that are driven by gardeners of all the <unk> of all the city and completely voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone <unk>
The city got to me above and a summary gave me a <unk> saying that I had to take my garden, the <unk> made <unk>
And I said, "Come on.
One order court for planting food in a piece of land that nobody <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's get <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
The L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a request in <unk> with 900 <unk> we went a success.
We had the victory of our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk>
It's <unk> miles of <unk>
That equals 20 <unk>
That's enough space for planting <unk> million <unk> plants.
Why does the hell it doesn't look like this?
<unk> a plant to a thousand, 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I would give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, growing your own food.
You get your own food in your own food to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up there. Tell my kids there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> from that canvas.
You can see what the Earth can be done, if they let it be their canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing a <unk> and how it affects the people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became an education tool of transformation in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You can see how to see the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one time, I remember a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> at night, and they were in my backyard, I went out and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this that way.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt embarrassed to see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people will go to steal your <unk>
I say, "Oh no, I'm not afraid that you go to <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at a time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me to download the truck.
It was great, they shared her stories about how this had affected them, and how they used to plant her mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how it changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant 20 <unk>
We've had a number of 50 people coming in, work and <unk> all of them on a volunteer.
If kids grow <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If they grow <unk> eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you're not taught how food affects your mind and the body -- they eat blind people who put them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they're wounded. I see kids of color that are on this path designed for them, which doesn't lead to anything.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to get rid of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my <unk> this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all of a block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into <unk> healthy.
I didn't get <unk>
I'm not talking about free, because free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people out and get the kids out of the streets who know the joy, the pride and honor of growing their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners of <unk>
We have to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
<unk> take your <unk>
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, they don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You would probably all agree with me in which this is a very bad street.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, which is a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that we can get into.
And especially if they are <unk> and these cars are actually going to be really nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, close to cities, we would want a very quiet <unk>
The solution for that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is asphalt a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, and it has pores and water can move through it, so that all the water water flows into the sides and have a road for which it's easy to drive, and they don't get water anymore.
Noise is also thrown into these <unk>
Because it's very fast, all the noise are going on, so it's a very quiet <unk>
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is it <unk> Look at the <unk> the stones on the surface of the surface <unk>
First of a stone, then several more and more and more and more, etc., and <unk> well, don't do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also bring more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see how the damage appears in this material.
It's a asphalt <unk> as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they <unk> they will <unk> and <unk> from the <unk>
So, if you drive along the road, you get the <unk> and you see it here.
So to solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool wool from that to clean up, and we can cut the <unk> steel into very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, very good at that.
So what you need to do is heat steel, melt <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones will go back to the surface.
Today I use a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big machine to <unk> here the stage.
<unk> <unk> is a similar system.
I put the sample that I'm going to pull out to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried many samples out there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 feet of the <unk> <unk> in which we had to make a lane of trial to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road road several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We did age the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the <unk> then with our machine of <unk> and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using the fibers of steel, bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the road, and even they can double the life of the road, and they can even double a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they're curious about if this also worked.
We still have shown here. It's pretty hot.
You actually have to cool it first before I can show you how the repair is <unk>
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to the BBC and his little gray radius of his little <unk>
I had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news generally <unk>
The Taliban <unk> <unk> my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now I can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban <unk> in Afghanistan and did illegal girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I would tell myself as a kid to <unk> my older sister who couldn't be used to go out to a secret school.
It was the only way we could have two could <unk>
Every day, we made a different route so that no one could suspect where they were going to be.
We had to hide books on market bag, so it looks like we were shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us packed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but it's extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our life -- the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every time when the school had suddenly closed for a week, because the Pakistani Taliban would die.
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> that his daughter, my mother, was out to school, and so her father will <unk> it.
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his whole family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, even though they're <unk>
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate her children.
For the years of the <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated about our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can let it leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, to do it.
So, you still want to <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than the school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate his daughters, it was one of the first ones in <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my college degree, but I was also the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I'm going to drive it through the streets in Kabul.
My family thinks in me.
I sleep in big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's why we <unk> <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
What's exciting is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to take the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like mine, <unk> for them, despite them, even though in front of a opposition opposition in front of it.
As <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on his way from <unk> to her village, and literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice told her that if he kept sending her daughter to the school, they would return to it.
<unk> already, if he <unk> he said, "but they not harm the future of my daughter for your old old <unk>
What I've realized from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who <unk> there's a father who recognized the value of their daughter and it sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers haven't been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> girls who went to school -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I think these changes didn't last a lot, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> by them, that <unk> I see a future <unk> and a <unk> change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> would be <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never go back to a revolutionary <unk> <unk>
They have spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution as <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a big revolution.
Women and young men were <unk> were at the middle, <unk> the each of the regime, the <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
Have you shown a copy of <unk> the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of a brutal war and a loss of about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the Tunisian regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of the <unk> society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I've wanted to do, next to many other women, rebuild the civil society, <unk> a inclusive transition and just toward democracy and national reconciliation and <unk>
We were set about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> nearly 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I came back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- began to organize workshops about the development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the Women's Women's <unk> <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, leaders, leaders to advocate for the women's autonomy of women and for our right of participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> a environment that was increasingly <unk> that <unk> out of the selfish policies of domination and domination
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a <unk> of National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news in violence.
One day you woke up with the news of the <unk> of ancient <unk> and <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American <unk> and the attack on <unk>
Another day woke up with the news of the murder of government officers from the army.
And every day, every day woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> human rights violations.
Our society, made by a <unk> mentality, and it's away from the ideals of freedom, dignity, social justice, social justice, we had the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all here at all about <unk> with our success story of <unk> <unk> and elections.
I'm pretty much here today to confess that we, as a nation, we chose wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize right.
Because the choices didn't bring peace and stability and safety to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation, <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> both by men like women?
Perhaps what it was missing was not only women, but the welfare values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than the elections, which only <unk> polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the more the other things that you need to do is <unk> and rescue it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call them a <unk>
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, which not only <unk> but also put it in practice that connects instead of <unk> and collaboration instead of the competition, and we put it instead of the competition, to flow instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by the war, needs desperately to be able to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about <unk> and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions of <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> which spans all of humanity and women, that all the tribes and all the villages and all the villages have <unk>
And so, as the uterus covers completely the <unk> which grows in, the divine matrix of compassion -- it <unk> the whole thing.
And this is what it tells us, "My <unk> dominated all the stuff."
So you say, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That all of you are being told by for mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a <unk> question, which has an equally <unk> response.
It is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the one that everybody does a great thing, why she's left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who <unk>
I'm not psychiatrist, or a social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that count.
I was 22 years old. I had just <unk> at the University of Harvard.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I was creating my alma mater, <unk> my head with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man, that I loved most of them in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> where fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for <unk> <unk> list, among them who Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington Post.
I've been about 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and drive a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all religions, all the income levels and education.
It's all over the place.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> relationships -- <unk> and <unk> or the other way in the families, the last place where we would want or expect to find <unk> which is why domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would sit with a man who sticks, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
It was 22 years old, and in the United States women in the age of 16, and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other age and over 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and rainy rainy night.
I was sitting next to my side of New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a University of <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But the thing that struck me about the first encounter was it was ready and funny, and that seemed a guy in the field.
I had a lot of <unk> big <unk> and a <unk> and wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of partner.
He did it especially at the beginning of it in a <unk>
We started to go out and loved everything in me, which was a list that I had to Harvard, which I would put passion in helping teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as I had ever done it before.
And it was why the arts degree in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to it.
I didn't know that the first stage in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk>
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York to leave my dreams, but I thought I had to do something for your partner, so I <unk> I left my work and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling in a <unk> <unk> which was entering a physical trap and financial and carefully <unk>
The next step of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And here is where those <unk> come into <unk>
And as soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where they're supposed to <unk> I had to feel so sure it bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one he kept him underneath the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed those guns to cause the trauma to the trauma that he lived in the board.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I'd never put up my hand, my hand, my life was already serious serious -- every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> was five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still have <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put my mother <unk> and I was married with him.
Even though what had happened, I was sure that we were living happily lived forever, because I loved her and he loved me.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of making a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and it never would hurt me.
I spent two times more in our water moon.
I was the first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that I would have a number of times against the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our <unk> of honey was <unk> by the traffic and threw me a Big Mac on the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two years and a half years of our marriage.
I <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had a great company.
So back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that could help <unk> <unk>
The other question that everybody does is why don't you just get <unk>
Why don't you <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we were victims, because we are victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in cases of domestic violence happen after the victim has come to the <unk> after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has returned to marry, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family family system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time with the man who <unk> their mother.
And we still keep asking why they simply don't go?
I was able to go, because of a last <unk> up to my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if there was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody around the world: the police, my neighbors and my friends and family and family to meet full strangers, and I'm here today because all of you.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why did you <unk>
For some people it's a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the victims of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But since I published <unk> I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also <unk> who learned a <unk> lesson from what happened and to <unk> their lives isolated and happy lives like <unk> wives like <unk> wives like mine.
Because it turns out I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I went back to marry a little cute little man, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to be able to have ever more, would never, ever be a <unk> gun pointing to my head of someone who says I want.
At this point, just like you're thinking: <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you there are a few people who are listening to me right now that they're being <unk> or that they were in small or that they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, her sister, her best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy love, break the silence.
And I'm still doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last appeal to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
The abuse is uniquely silent.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence just shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
I <unk> the abuse of the light talking about it with their children, their <unk> their friends and family.
<unk> your view of survivors like fantastic and <unk> people who have a future <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down his climb and show the victims a safe go.
Together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis of insurance and <unk> that should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call <unk> Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point, there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because it shouldn't have dressed me like that.  I'm lucky, I've brought it clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift from clothing on a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of luck from <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to <unk> now, but to find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. They're very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to go through this sweater for your head, because it's when you're going to laugh for me, so don't do anything while I cover my mind.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I have totally changed what you thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that he <unk> her back and <unk> her hair and <unk> her hair.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan -- like the one that I made two days ago for work, there is very little as we can do to transform our looks, which, even though superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, right?
Because I'm a nice woman, white, and in my work sector that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be a role model?
I always say, <unk> <unk> was discovered, but it doesn't mean nothing.
The real reason why I made a model that I made model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last few centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we've also associated with a high and <unk> shape, and to a white skin.
And that's my <unk> <unk> that I've known to harness them to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who now show up <unk> and maybe some of the <unk> of the fashion they <unk> Hold on. So there are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk>
First, <unk> for knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York and told all of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only about four percent, were not white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when you <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I didn't take care of that.
But then, what I would really tell you to each one of these girls is, why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you're the first one.
If after this spectacular list, still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> <unk> <unk> or the CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that more you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike surgical surgery, it can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you've got your studies, and you have a few, and you have a few jobs on your back, no matter what you <unk> is to say, if you <unk> you want to be president of the United States, but your <unk> Model Model for 10 years, people will be <unk>
The next question that people are always doing is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, they almost <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture I <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know that we're entering the ground, but it was a little girl.
So I was looking at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in the <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you will realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They're <unk> <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is to do things for free?
I've got too much about 20 inches and I never use, except the <unk> but the privileges I know are the ones I get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I went to a shop and I forgot to take money to get money and gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he climbed into a red light and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges in my appearance, not because of what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their mind regardless of who they are.
I live in New York, and the past year, of <unk> teenagers who were missing and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
It's how many times I get <unk> and <unk>
When we do research for this talk, I learned that by 53 percent of the 13 percent of the U.S. girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to the 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, smart and <unk>
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them.
And I am because I have to worry about my day every day.
And if you ever get people -- with a more thin legs, and the brilliant, I will be happier?
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs that have the brightest and the brightest <unk> but they probably are the <unk> physically <unk>
But especially it was hard to look at a <unk> situation and gender oppression when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to keep this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image of the image that we have about success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was more enough to hold up a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 photos <unk> and I didn't know who I <unk>
There were no directors and no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a very low care in lighting.
In fact, most of all, they take them tourists at random.
My story begins when, in New York City to give a <unk> my wife put me up with this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That is the <unk> corner of <unk>
And it happened that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why not you get to <unk> in New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists who were going to make us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is as universal.
No one has ever denied and, fortunately, no one has ever <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much it would change life this journey.
It became sacred about us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that it had happened in the way that a five-year-old could understand.
These pictures are much more than the representations of a particular time or a specific journey.
They're also a way of stopping time in October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only on the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, though you always take the same picture, our own perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That concrete time that we spend together is something that we expect with illusion every year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking around the <unk> when you suddenly stopped on a dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the <unk> shop that I wrote in a little <unk>
And it described to me what felt like five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> remembered his heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York City.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we create are the memories.
So I want to share the idea of participating in conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family photos.
I'm always a picture of it.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you don't want to get closer to someone and asked, do you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> group.
First, why do they have such bad <unk>
It's also been associated with Disney laughter as a <unk> dumb characters as stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press and the <unk> and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I do not accept that?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  <unk> don't help us prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   And my favorite, the <unk> have a better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World that are primarily in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> of the World Bank -- where we have 16 species from those 16, and 11 face with a high risk of extinction.
So, why are they <unk> First, first of all, provide vital ecological services.
They're our natural garbage <unk>
They <unk> the cadavers to bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria and they help to absorb the anthrax -- that not to be because of them would spread and caused huge losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have a huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of <unk> and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and below Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are very important to open heaven to open sky, in places like Tibet, is nowhere to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What is the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, that six are in extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities, use this poison against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the endangered endangered species, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years <unk> and the reason is because they fall out of the livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned from <unk> in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs you have a huge amount of time bomb.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind parks in Africa, <unk> <unk> they're going to be up from the <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines will do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In Western Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so that you can focus on a home problem is not going to be at all.
We have to work with governments at <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we get.
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to their government and tell you to have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you get out of this room, you will tell you about <unk> but talk to your families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that it changed because he saw it by flying without effort, no energy expenditure into the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I don't.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> at the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Rather than that, everything that we <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people of Zambia to grow food.
So we got to <unk> seeds to the south of Zambia to this absolutely wonderful valley, that descends into the river <unk> and teach local tomatoes and teach local tomatoes and <unk> and and ...
And of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they would teach them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't get <unk>  We were <unk> in that fertile valley, they didn't have had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we don't know -- we just said, "Thank God we are here --  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa became <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato procedure going to grow into this size.
And we couldn't believe that we were saying to the <unk> "Look at how easy it is <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red from the night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "My God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here --  "Why don't you <unk> "You never <unk>
I thought just of us Italians <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the American Americans, what they were doing -- what the French did, and then seeing what they were doing, and after seeing what they were doing, I was quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> look at the <unk>  <unk> look at the waste that we would give them to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, the Western donors have led to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
Don't tell you about the damage that money has <unk>
Just read their book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
We are the Westerners -- we are a <unk> missionaries of <unk> and we treat people only from two things: or <unk> or are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if they were my children, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of the different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white people in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face. Little little is <unk> written by <unk> who said about all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This is supposed to be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, we can -- you can imagine you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided I was able to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start to see anything, you never start to anybody, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local <unk> who have the dream to become a better person.
So what do you do? You <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and they sit with people from <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We put together in a cafe. We put together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give it an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years ago and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, in a place to get to a community to tell people what to do, why not once, for once, I mean, not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never tell them in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have you <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know -- because they don't attending their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one, and we work on a face -- you have to create a social infrastructure, which is no one that doesn't exist.
You should create a new profession.
The profession is the family physician in the company, the family doctor, who is established with you in your house, at the table in your kitchen table, and that helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city from West Australia, West areas.
I was doing a Ph.D. in the time, trying to move away from this <unk> garbage where we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something really, really difficult.
I <unk> and <unk>   So the government says, <unk> --         So the government is done in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> of history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor in philosophy before they engage in business, and this is what Peter <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of death of the <unk>
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> not knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you with you.
You have to offer you, <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then you're going to come up in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
So what do you show you is you <unk> this tomorrow?
People are <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm saying is that the spirit entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil fossils not renewable -- <unk> and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There is a lovely story that in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> came together with this group of people -- and they talked about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City, wouldn't be within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve, and <unk> if the population stays growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> they were dung.  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that they would make the life of New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States showed up, <unk> generic companies.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, you're not going to come up with you.
Then, you have to offer you an absolute <unk> <unk>
And then finally, you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company, it has to be able to do three things: the product you want to sell has to be fantastic -- you have to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic <unk> and you have to tell with a great financial administration.
You know what?
I've never met a single human being in the world that can do, selling and pay for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This was not not born.
We have research and looked at the 100 <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford, all new <unk> Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one, no one went started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of business in bars in bars together with their dedicated comrades who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who is talking about this <unk> somebody who asked you, what does them?
What can you? Can you do that?
Okay, can you <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do this."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us around us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we didn't survive a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public places.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door to a bad time?
How do we share more memories from our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
So how do we share our hopes for the cows and so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds <unk> with the wild <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries for centuries and I trust a city.
And the music is always supporting the music --  there's a show in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful artifacts in the world, but also one with the largest number of hidden properties.
I live close to this house and I thought I could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood, and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And this produced a profound gratitude for life and lived in the time.
It led to the significant things of my life today.
But let me keep this in my daily life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch up on the day and forget what's really important to one.
So with the help of old and new friends I transformed the wall of this <unk> house on a giant <unk> and he painted it on her phrases to <unk> "Before they die <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die -- I want to be tested by <unk>  "Before I die -- I want to sit down in the line of <unk>
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people to <unk>
Before we die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died I want to live outside the <unk>
Before we die I want to ask ourselves once more."
Before I died, I want to go to the rescue <unk>
Before we die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and the hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me <unk> and they gave me <unk>
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and new ways that is about <unk> thinking and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages from the passionate people who wanted to do a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues at the civic center, we did a kit and now have been made out walls around the world, like South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of increasing, increasing, is more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remembering that life is short and delicate life.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we are going to prepare for death is one of those things that would give us more power.
If you think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as community and more means to share hope and fears and the people around us cannot help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old and very <unk>
She doesn't talk about, but it's transmitting joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what the love.
You share it <unk> whatever happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the skin color.
They don't care about religious differences and notice this: it's never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to say words of the ones I couldn't even <unk> it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel <unk> 16 years old. It's very hot.
You will get the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year he came out of the <unk> songs of my iPod, conversations that we <unk> when I was four years old, would be pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and <unk> birthday birthday <unk>
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of <unk> of society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But the thing that propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although you didn't consider them inside of it, that could only mean one thing: that were <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, to learning, and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it plays in a different way, from there that <unk> is so different from Sam.
And all around the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with autism, and even though it's one of the developmental disorders that faster increase in the world, there is no cause or cure <unk>
I don't agree with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I had only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
Let's get a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
I lived in living and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and he found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in line around the room, watching the washing machine, and eat anything that was <unk>
As I was growing up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond <unk> the frustration and frustration and <unk> -- there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature, a child looking at the world without prejudice, a human being had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments when I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that I've been taught about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they are things that wouldn't want to change the normal.
The <unk> passes on high the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean anybody is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could put it up one thing to <unk> and by Sam and you know, you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, <unk> or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us have a gift on their interior and honestly, the search for <unk> is the last <unk> of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time where we try to be as many as others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher to give up a kind of communication to students from engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> of truth -- <unk> of these students with their great minds, their great books and their big, unknown and unknown words.
But when they develop those conversations, I felt what I was going to do, must have felt that when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
Just like that I felt when I had these conversations with the students, I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We need desperately a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to the environment and health care, among others, and if we don't even know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not inviting us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions on how you can do it to make sure that you can see that their science is sexy and its engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't just tell us that we study the <unk> but study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, carefully <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of its ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making them dumb things.
On the contrary, as Einstein said, everything as easy as possible, but it's not simple.
It can clearly communicate their science without engaging ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- are ways of connecting and <unk> with their content.
And when I present his job, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you ever wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do the <unk> kill, and they <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's supporting too much in the language of the language of our brains and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a very simple quote -- <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphics that <unk> our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what it is <unk>
I think these are just some keys that can help the other open the door and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when we've solved this equation, because of all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all in Oxford English is <unk>
Just because it sounds great.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor of the 19th century, that defined it a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that the <unk> is the one who seeks a public charge no matter or a platform, and when he wins, he gets it through the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that they were saying in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was due to the bravery of a guy with the <unk> <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
They put her into the <unk> <unk> and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to tackle them, and at the end he had such popular support in London that won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for a <unk> of freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the United States, just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington to their leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some people wanted to call it <unk> of the state of <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the People in the United States.
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was proven quality.
And not even with that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given term.
And there might be <unk>
Everybody got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and <unk> was that the House House was against the <unk>
The White House didn't want Washington to <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it King for if it did or her designated ideas.
So they wanted to give it the most <unk> and more unfortunate title than they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> presidents of little <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of government, but it really was a insignificant.
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign together with <unk> <unk>
"And who is serious about a very ridiculous title, and insignificant as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite way to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate never <unk> it as a <unk> title.
President Barack Obama is lucky enough to keep on there, waiting for the Senate to action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we will keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this, I want to tell you, is that the president of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
And especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads and <unk> the largest economy of the world and a fleet of the air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story have been charged with the title.
So the end won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness of the time.
But you know how many nations have <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now the president of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and what I'd like to do is <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, reality changes much more words, the words that these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet underground.
The air is <unk> and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that you talk about, but above all, this cacophony of <unk> <unk> and rocks <unk> with primitive tools.
Like others, I carry on a cheap <unk> of light, tied to the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the branches of that <unk> <unk> walls on the ground.
I was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> <unk> who lost the control and fell countless feet on that hole.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep way of that hole at the risk of their lives without pay, and, often, dying.
I went out of that hole and went home, but they might never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> in the World Summit <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there met a <unk> <unk> a NGO who is dedicated to eradicating modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not about a degree.
When we ended up talking to me, I was very <unk> honestly I was <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He got me <unk> my stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that currently there are over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much of the number of Africans displaced throughout the whole animal <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a slave slave was about three times a annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars today.
And yet, today, you can <unk> entire families for generations, for <unk> <unk>
Surprisingly, slavery generates over more than 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promise of good education and better work to find that they are forced to work without pay, under the threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves are <unk> but the ones that produce them are disposable them.
slavery exists in almost all the world, and yet it's illegal for all the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange show and formidable was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, children, in fact, families -- entire families <unk> into a heavy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks to their heads, to 18 at the time, and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 -- 17 hours a day.
There was no <unk> to eat, not to eat, and severe <unk> made it pee out pretty <unk>
As <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera got too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the equipment and make it work that would work with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, I was like, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side I was going quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it here."
And it explained to me very clearly that I will demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not citizenship from that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his liberation and trusted <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found kids <unk> stones for miles on <unk> land until they were waiting at the bottom.
These great <unk> were more heavy than the kids that load them and children <unk> their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been like this whole life.
Do you have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> has completely <unk>
When you hear the word slavery we often think of sexual trafficking and because of this global awareness of the <unk> they told me that it would be hard to me to work with safety in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
It took me a few <unk> <unk> that gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more a restaurant.
<unk> as a lot of <unk> are in local <unk>
They have small rooms -- private rooms where <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven years old -- they're forced to entertain the customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember there is a <unk> scary fear and in that moment, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that <unk>
I just had a <unk> the stairs where you were <unk>
There was no <unk>
There wasn't big enough windows to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a subject that is so hard, it's important to point out that slavery even the sexual <unk> happens all around us.
There are hundreds of people involved in agriculture, <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 children are sold every year as sex as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor of labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were whole families <unk> in the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait of family.
<unk> hands are from the father, the <unk> of blue and red, from their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
But yet we can get out of this house someday and go to another place where you really pay for our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we got there, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what it seemed to be a <unk> family in a boat, two older siblings, some younger kids, and they make sense of it?
<unk> were all slaves.
Children are separated from their <unk> families, <unk> and forced to work with extensive <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to come up with it was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by fear of falling into the water.
<unk> branches in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear is thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since <unk> has always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of her love not to flee and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it tries to the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were <unk> the latest networks, but they had been working from the <unk>
At the cold night and <unk>
And it would point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're sitting with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes how possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
He <unk> by a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his <unk> <unk> and <unk> our car and touched the window.
He asked us to do it on a way of land to the forest.
At the end of the way, we were going to go out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
And then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the path, this is the road.
As we started down, we took away the <unk> and we took off the way and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as I put the photos on the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up in one of course and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football field, and everyone were full of <unk> workers.
Many women had children attached to their backs, and as they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> water.
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump were <unk> in his own sweat.
I remember watching his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> are up to 90 feet and these people have lost heavy stone bags that will then be shipped to another area where they <unk> the stone to be able to extract the gold.
To the first sight, it seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer than close to the side, the margin is to work at least and also as children.
They're all victims of injury and disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up as this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
When his uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle as they force him to be a slave in the mines.
When I met him, I had worked in 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet that is forced to work on night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being liberated and educated with the help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this is this kind of determination, a face to a remote possibility that I'm inspired by a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on the <unk>
Did you know that your images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we'll get testimony to them and that we'll do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves from each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to <unk> atrocities like slavery.
These images are not <unk> they're from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that happens I don't think about these so many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images wake up a force in which you see you see, in people like you, and I hope that you will turn on a fire and that fire <unk> over slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I'm doing math math and there's a particular problem for whom the <unk> are like the management team.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human.
We were <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> dancers --  that we'll see later on.
But the ballet requires a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably some <unk> <unk> that can well have a genetic component that well.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's Parkinson's destroy this extraordinary skill -- as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time, was a <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the last few years, it has been made a lot of progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> billion people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know if there's really a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers, and so they don't serve the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological exam for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of clinical trials, they never have been done.
And what if the patients could do it at home?
That would save the clinical trip to the clinic. What if the patients could be tested <unk>
It doesn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is, I want to <unk> as a conventional form of a try, as you see, in some sense, at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the <unk> <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds at speak, and we can imagine as a <unk> ballet dancers because we have to coordinate all these vocal vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes for example.
And like they did not, it requires an extraordinary training.
Let's think about time that leads to a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of the vocal cords as we <unk> and as well as Parkinson's disease affects <unk> it also affects the <unk>
In the plots of the bottom you can see an example of <unk> <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
shake a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more peaceful and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with clinical clinical trials -- well, they're both <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> They both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
They're both <unk> OK, but also the <unk> tests are not <unk>
That is, they can be <unk>
They are very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're low cost, and we all know what happens happening.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it shows up on mass <unk>
These are some amazing goals.
We can reduce the <unk> difficulty of patients.
I don't need to go to the clinic for the <unk> <unk>
With high <unk> we could get objective data.
We could do recruitment at low cost for clinical trials, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it is too late.
So by giving up today the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk> <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these goals.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> or <unk> can call at low price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So I <unk> taking all these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the so-called <unk> you have to indicate if you have or not the disease of TR: Right.
<unk> You can see, some people can not <unk> You might not get it.
But we're going to get a very large cross-section of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion factors in search of real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have a <unk> accuracy at this time?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has done a fantastic work and now has shown that it works in the mobile phone network, as well, what we have the project -- now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max public <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of the 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We <unk> in the dark, <unk> rooms, and they usually avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin still even more perfect -- we do the impossible possible -- and we can get rid of the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a talent with many years of experience and a real taste of the imagery and photography.
On March 11 of the 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that was going on in Japan.
Shortly after, a organization where it was <unk> where they were <unk> <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the <unk>
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay in home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May <unk> I traveled to <unk>
It's a small <unk> village in the <unk> of nearly 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The level of water has gotten more than 24 feet high, and over three kilometers into the ground inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
You know, schools.
We removed tons and tons of fish dead, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and they loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found photos and <unk> photos and cameras and <unk> cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
They <unk> and bring them to different places from the villages around the <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean up the <unk> bathrooms -- giant <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And there were the honor that they were going to do, and I had the honor of that day to be <unk> by hand.
So this was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression to think beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until we go beyond myself my horizons something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that they had more than a hundred years old, some were still in the lab in the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> how to fix that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to do with a lot of precision and <unk>
Anyway, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as I had the photo <unk>
With the step of time, they came to be lucky, and they needed more <unk> and so I walked back into Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people of 12 countries was offered to help.
When two weeks I had 150 people <unk> from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we would <unk> a village and neighbor people north of <unk>
Once in the week we use our scanner in the libraries of time <unk> time that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, dependent on the <unk> of the photos.
It could be <unk> I could make a couple of weeks.
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw practically by hand using the areas that the color and detail the water was not destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these photos and underwater <unk> covered with bacteria, with algae even oil, all of it in the time with the step of the time I continue to <unk> that by hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't <unk> the photo unless it were clean and dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We tell the guidance of a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more photos by <unk>
As once said <unk> the leader of my group is like to do a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was kind of a relationship to the photos.
I had started to <unk> her itself but stopped when you realize that they would get them even further.
It also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When I collected their pictures shared something from his story with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the photos at a fire station between the rubble far away from where she used to be their house, but their colleagues would be <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside of the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different countries.
One of them was trapped in the water.
She took a week to find his whole family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave him his photos on his youngest son <unk>
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could do to look at, something I could remember from the past one that had had not been marked on the day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up there.
Over 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring up to 90 hundreds of <unk> photos and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them on ink to <unk>
We take photos constantly.
One photo is a memory of someone or something, a <unk> <unk>
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would take, but the first thing we would take to look for.
What this was about the project, of restore little bits of mankind, to bring back to someone with the past.
When you look at a picture like this, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that receives it.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger, bring something larger, using their talent for something that don't be thin <unk>
To conclude, I'd like to read this email. I sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular -- a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, and I was <unk> because a little picture of my family -- my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother,
In the whole world, in every few our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and seeing the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technical technique that can create a slow motion of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the interior of the body without using X-rays, and challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch on it and put it into a second of a second, it is, in a number of <unk> to create a pile of photons from just a millimeter <unk>
And that package of photons, that <unk> traveling at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common <unk>
So if we took that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do those photons come from?
What's the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all these things --  -- remember, all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to you about traveling the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a stimulus package that starts to <unk> and that inside, it starts to <unk>
And some of the light <unk> goes on the table, and we start seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally comes to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table, and because of the reflections of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights would be <unk>
Now, if we take a common <unk> and we make it go down the same distance and we see it in slow down to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us sit to see that film?
One day?
It would be a very boring film -- a <unk> slow movement.
And how about <unk> <unk>
You can see the waves that were <unk> from the table, the tomato and the background wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, and I thought about a <unk> at a time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of <unk>
But if you look at more and more of the <unk> it will realize that, as the lights went out of the <unk> it still <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light goes back into its inside and it goes back into a number of <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to have to <unk>
What do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture of the <unk> <unk> it goes very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest <unk> so I'll just go into some light.
We sent that <unk> that <unk> million times, and we recorded over and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took these data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all these raw data in crude and <unk> way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can come together.
And if a new power of the future <unk> would allow him to see after <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You'll go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
And we could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We have built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> light at the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera but interestingly, slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works like this fast, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It has very good time resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point it corresponds to the distance.
When a laser project you can record a picture in <unk> that, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
Can we see it in <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this in the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> collisions.
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at the lights reflected through open windows and open windows.
Or we could be able to build <unk> able to see the body inside of the body doing <unk> and the same thing for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood is quite hard, so actually this is an order to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new modality of <unk> to solve the problems of <unk> health problems.
So as a <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, he turned science into art, an art of <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect every single time is not just for scientific visualizations but we can see it.
So creating a new form of computer photography, with slow motion and color code.
And let's look at those <unk> Remember, the time between each one of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here's something that's fun.
If we look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order of the events that events in the world sometimes appears in the camera.
<unk> the corresponding <unk> of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A cell phone can <unk> life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone you can put a crime against humanity in Syria.
You can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and put it famous.
This is all possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a <unk> in 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment to this town.
Here you can see the hundreds of thousands of people looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathering that <unk> for a change, had a cell phone in our pocket.
Who is a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot of people today have a mobile phone.
But today I'm talking about me, my mobile, and how changed my life changed.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> lines of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every single cell phone company, every single <unk> Internet company has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and until two years, in his phone company or his Internet <unk>
And in all Europe, people stood in and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone <unk> and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, and they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who went out to the streets in Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> <unk>
<unk> was the secret police of East Africa.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all of this information about us?
Every time you use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> that then was the largest telephone company in Germany, "Please get me all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask yourself, and I didn't get a particular answer -- it was all <unk>
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end, they <unk>
They sell the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
At the beginning I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
I was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step past the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and <unk> go backwards and forward.
You can see every step I want to do.
And you can see how I'm going to go on the train to <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not only about me.
It's from all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, and we talk a couple times.
Then they call me some friends and they call them among them.
And then one calls the other, and the other one another, and we ended up with this huge network of communication.
You can see how your people communicates each other to what time they call each other, to what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who sent an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in my pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall was probably never happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because now the state agencies and business agencies want to store so much information from us as it could be in and out of the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to <unk> them forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital era is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value and not yet <unk>
When you go home, you go home to your representative that just because business agencies can store some information, don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone phones, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that are going on to remind you that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, so it <unk> all the time.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> I'm like a mix of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> cannot <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus -- of my mother and not the <unk> because my parents were cousins, even though they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you -- I'm not a source of inspiration -- I don't want any of you to have any of them today.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they wish to be disabled
Come on for a walk.
<unk> Christmas <unk> are in the shopping mall, they drive around parking lot and what do you see?
16 places in empty places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I say, I've got 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There's a <unk> of the <unk> I would win.
I'm <unk> Muslim woman, woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you might have to do it.
I'm from <unk> <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood, and my disease would have the same first.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, it might.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk> <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents went to the school system, and they were <unk> that I was also out of my own, and if we didn't take all the <unk> all the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at age five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang up a dollar in front of me so that they were able to <unk> it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion who has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there was only six Arab in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 <unk> and they're still all in the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> as <unk>
The people I grew up with had no problem with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot like a lot of hunger in the <unk>
I was telling them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating three months without eating, so I <unk> from dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so I was sent to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whether I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends wear <unk> I am too.
And when my friends were going to pass on the summer holidays on the coast of <unk> I was not going.
I spent my summers on a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine -- all the <unk> would be <unk>
On the summer holidays often my father was trying to <unk> so I drank <unk> milk -- put me warm cups on the back, and I was <unk> on the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I thought, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before I make yoga it was a comedian that he could not stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it on the head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college, through positive discrimination and I got a grant to the University of Arizona, University, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the name of the theater department.
All of my <unk>
I did all of the least intelligent tasks I took out the top note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> <unk> I'll have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the end of the <unk>
Thank God <unk> I end up with <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the director of the theater department crying in crying -- historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, what and she told me that because they thought I could not make the scenes at risk.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunt stunt stunts I can't do the <unk> either.
It was a role for which he was literally born and gave it to an actor.
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
At <unk> I went home, and my first <unk> tour, was like extra <unk>
My dream was made true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there like a <unk> and it didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was evident to me that the directors of <unk> didn't <unk> actors -- not white, with disability.
Just <unk> people perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
On my first tour tour, I took the famous <unk> of New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that I took when he fell at the realization that I was at high speed at the <unk> of New Jersey with a <unk>
I worked in clubs.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that they never heard that little sound that says that women are not fun, and they find it fun to us.
In 2003, my brother brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Film Festival from New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in the media, in the media and to remind the school directors that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs was much easier to fight against the challenge of <unk>
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the cable news program behind with Keith <unk>
I walked as if I was to a graduate dance, I would join a studio and sat down to a studio and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clinging to the <unk> desk to not get out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but she stayed as <unk> and hit my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct Keith <unk> was that the people on the Internet are <unk>
It is said that kids are <unk> but they never get rid of me and a child and a little bit of a child.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
I wrote online clips with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It is <unk>
And my favorite favorite -- my favorite <unk>
What does it do that?
We really ought to pray for this."
A <unk> suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't do somebody in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, as I grew up with media, I don't think it was <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there was more positive images, I would have less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
We may still use the whole society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet, by the <unk> of <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a movie with Adam <unk> and to work with my <unk> this incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world." The Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in a representation of the great state of New Jersey in 2008.
And I founded "The <unk> <unk> a charity to give Syrian refugee kids -- a tiny little bit of what my parents <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me live live, and I do this talk to your memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child from a small town.
I don't know her name, but I know her story.
She lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives the village to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> capital in Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, no job, no perspectives for the future.
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After a year that's a <unk> nothing.
One day he was about a gentleman that offers him to <unk> after dinner to <unk>
He knows a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
He's getting a little bit of money so that they bought new clothes to send your family home, your family.
He presented a young man.
They finally got home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a car bomb.
That little boy from that little town with dreams of the great city was the terrorist terrorist <unk> and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a terrorist connected organization to al Qaeda.
So how a child story of a young boy trying to fulfill his dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future of future, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that pulled it out of what we call "the <unk> <unk>
And its story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the history of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the chance of the opportunity, of jobs, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people who live in cities are going to be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the history of the <unk> <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to <unk> to be the history of <unk>
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember sitting in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had seen it forced to be in that same <unk>
It would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to park a few young leaders at a business summit rate.
<unk> to about 90 youth leaders.
We sat down and we had a <unk> of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because I was a graduate graduate college college student, was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to reach from point A to B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war, have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle may be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
They started <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford to.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some point in order to expand hundreds of <unk> for the next three years.
Why is this story?
What makes this story different?
I think your ability to identify and take a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think the entrepreneurial spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so long.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to tell you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of entrepreneurial initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic sent from the abroad.
If you give somebody, "When did you last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he began to grow <unk> and <unk> that he said, could actually survive the hard climate <unk>
And he started the <unk> delivery of flowers to create gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now he's working on the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow rose because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They've never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGOs working for the government, but their story, their innovation, actually had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs who might be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They <unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people and create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit is really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need the experience and guidance in the development and put out of their businesses.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed isn't just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His <unk> <unk> that's what it calls it when it's created, transforming the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the motorcycles for it.
He gave them an opportunity to escape <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> <unk> area.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not going to be on the way that <unk> almost we can pretend we were the first human beings to step onto that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> <unk> of about four square feet with hearts -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And he was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get out what they were doing, who thought he was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where do you <unk> the <unk> who cleans our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> the <unk> of the reason for 11 tons of waste and 5,000 tons of <unk> every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who makes that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through her routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities around the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now not just I was traveling in the trucks.
They picked up the mechanical <unk> and bar the snow bar.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as <unk> as you think, and in the days that it's very strong you can get <unk> quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years and their bodies continued to <unk> the weight of getting over their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> garbage collection is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and moving into traffic all day and pass around around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also, the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall from the truck. And cause terrible damage to it.
I also learned about how relentless <unk>
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is as a force of nature itself.
It will never stop coming.
It's also like a kind of breathing or circulation.
It always must be in motion.
And also, the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is particularly ironic because I believe strongly that <unk> are the most important labor in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in a very efficient and effective way every day, this starts <unk> from their <unk> and their dangers inherent in the very real ways.
So we had run for decades, and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs the economy.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have space for what the engines of the economy begin to fail when it's endangered at the time.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just hit your relationship.
And then there is what I call our average speed of daily <unk>
And I mean by just the speed at which we used to move in the time.
They usually don't <unk> us or clean up or we got our coffee cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a work force on the other side that you get to it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human city.
Her job, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every single day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when to <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us safely from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow always has to stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11th in 2001, I heard the <unk> of a garbage collection truck in the street, I grabbed my little boy and went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all of the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and he said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that I started to investigate waste collection and went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> and we work together and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have to account all the costs, even the very real human cost.
The municipal waste is what we think about when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of your life, and in their lives, the next one that you see someone whose work is to clean up the garbage of you, you know, a moment to <unk>
I would give you a moment to tell you to thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example began with an invitation to design a commercial center of several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, <unk>
This is the kind of construction that they showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores in which people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to use a lot of energy because the MRI <unk> generates heat into the interior, so it takes a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it comes to a temperate climate that goes 20 to 25 degrees during the whole year.
And third, what does it look like with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> for a place that rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was actually captivated with the old market that is the open market structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a new building, of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to survey the site, which is located in a lot of the whole area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, not existed.
And there's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in a <unk> body.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, <unk> all the entries in the building.
And this spread out with a <unk> <unk> which creates an open space in the building that <unk> in its own way, the sun and the rain.
And around this space we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, that changes on every floor because of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would be <unk> to the local conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric to a <unk> <unk> <unk> to allow the air to the air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
And then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little little pieces of <unk> which are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors crystals that use the light inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it was not easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- not what they <unk>
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the mall would be much more profitable than the mall because in order to sell more local bills to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it didn't need to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy energy for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting into the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with the meeting areas and bars that would create this <unk> <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, and they collect water for the <unk>
It's expected for the next year, since we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a project that's so big -- the biggest thing that I have to do, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also in his environment, its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I set special attention on the <unk> a thousand years old that was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors of connecting <unk> connected lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was extend the streets to create 12 early blocks similar to the size and features there in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some of the strategic dots in relation to the idea of the doors of <unk> with straight lines, and this will change the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we would take a scheme that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant, we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
It also responds to local norms that set up higher density at higher levels and a lower density in the plant.
And it <unk> this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community to space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can go up and <unk> and do activities, like running a race of two miles in the morning, or jumping out of one building to another building.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they are in emerging countries, where you can see the cities of literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes the communities and local economies at the same pace growing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment that they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had a very bright load of hair, and it had a little <unk> of cute <unk> I was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good at <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy until I <unk> my sinister <unk>
I was a time after a time after the <unk> was a little late and I hid in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took on the classroom, I took the book of grades.
And then, I did.
<unk> the ratings in my <unk> just a little bit, just a few Exactly.
All the way --  And I signed up to bring the book back to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had really good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, no imagination.
I put in all of the rows of <unk> and myself a row of the way, just to be there, because I will be there.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that it was all obvious <unk>
I never <unk>
But above all, I <unk> the reason why I really bothered me, that this little little little little little girl, was so small to <unk>
I <unk> the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
We also primates. The <unk> birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause on the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that would be able to <unk> the loneliness, or the <unk> or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab in which you study <unk> in all of their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no exaggeration to say that if it didn't have been literature.
Well, it wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
You wouldn't have king <unk> no <unk> and a <unk>
It would not be <unk>
I went through the <unk> <unk> <unk> because we would be missing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, There is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of jealousy almost that they have all of them.
This year is 100 years of his masterpiece, "In <unk> of the <unk> time, the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also of the ordinary <unk> of course, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk>
I don't know what the cat <unk> is, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious how the jealousy, who are reduced to the person, to their wish, their <unk> are a <unk> foundation.
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy we tell ourselves a story.
One story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details you <unk> to <unk> the <unk> right?
The <unk> make us all <unk> <unk> and that's something that we had understood understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure I could give to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say itself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool charm that <unk> it detects on his lover, he adds to his collection of instruments of instruments in his private camera.
I have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotional emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> from information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> I like the large quantities of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> were <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links the <unk> language with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in her <unk> agony of soon listening to the doors of his lover -- so it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're scientific research with real <unk> value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make it seem like <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, search for the truth, a painful truth, in fact, to <unk> the more painful truth the truth, better.
The pain, <unk> <unk> These were the way to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to, that makes us suffer, causes us to make a range of more profound feelings and vital than a wise man who can be <unk>
It's telling us that let's go and look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> are reveal us themselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
Is there any other emotion <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at so <unk>
Freud would write about this later on.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young woman who was being used with the idea that her woman would <unk> him.
And Freud says that there was something weird about that man who doesn't get <unk> in what his wife's did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that was doing his wife, not realizing <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> with a man?
Freud says that man is becoming the <unk> of the unconscious <unk>
Things are really good at this.
Things describe very well how <unk> makes us look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more <unk> the more <unk> the more we are, we become <unk>
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts of <unk>
<unk> led us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at eight years old -- I think, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about the news.
A woman who was Michigan from 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from which they would be sent messages to text <unk> awful self for a year.
For one year, a year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when or I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How big -- although <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She is a very strange character from American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that deal with how the jealousy, <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to take on your self and <unk> what you once <unk> and it's under the floor <unk> your name, brings your rings, empty bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> around the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we are good <unk> of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're facing a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the curse of Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always heard <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief face of rat <unk> <unk> that needs to <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs your help, but they <unk> it and <unk> with <unk> in each one of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The Six of the Six <unk> once you <unk> <unk> all of your solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We are not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to raise your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat them as a problem of geometry, without excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> there is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
All of a sudden, you will be able to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be relative to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the greatness of the other.
We can <unk> with it.
But I like the <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, let's remember that we have the fiction.
Only fiction <unk> the jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> the terrifying <unk> the <unk> Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> very Marcel Proust
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, of 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the Apollo <unk> module.
Armstrong and fathers were alone, but their presence in the surface gray on the surface of the <unk> <unk> process.
The Apollo program was the greatest race of peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA was spending about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo delivered to about 400,000 people and asked the 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died, including Apollo <unk>
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, of which <unk> <unk> after <unk> death, the past year, is now the most <unk>
So, why is it <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation was better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some ask, why does the <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why scale the most <unk> mountain.
So 35 years ago, why fly over the <unk>
Why is Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
So we chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're too simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West about the Cold War.
At the time, the hardest emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the Moon happened in a context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century, produced the assembly line and the airplane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they were <unk> <unk> and eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle -- but in 1969, the crew of the Apollo 10 miles an hour of time.
From 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism <unk> about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems that we imagined technology would solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the global population seem to be <unk>
I remember watching the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't belong to the <unk> <unk> tube from the rocket. Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was totally sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that <unk> happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard about the last two days here at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have found us, and they would have <unk> with trivial, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But they don't <unk> the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years that we will have <unk> <unk> Microsoft, and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, specifically, the incentives that risk capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused the creation of ideas -- for the funding of <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the risk venture capitalists were at their high point without caring about the risk, they preferred smaller investments that they could get out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with benefit in technologies as well as energy, which need massive capital and whose development is long-term <unk> have not invested in developing technologies intended to solve large problems because they don't have a commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound problems.
Sometimes, we chose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we could go through it.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption -- from renewable energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want to be ways of alternative energy sources that can compete at the price don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and international treaties <unk> the development of an energy <unk> <unk> a significant increase in research and development development, and some control control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see a U.S. policy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, they are not to be.
We know for time that famines are a result of failure.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and food <unk> but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president Nixon was declared war in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant kinds of cancer, and only in the last 10 years seem to have been found effective and viable treatments and viable.
<unk> problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can have and we need to do, but these four elements have been <unk> political and political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, institutions must have to support the <unk> it must really be a <unk> problem, and we should understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve large problems, it is true with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there's no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like the <unk> system.
In general, to go to the moon it turned out to be simple.
I was only three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they have become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decline of trust, which is a very generalized view.
The second is a goal: we should have more confidence.
And the third is a <unk> we should reclaim trust.
I think <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task that I think gives you a more clear idea about it.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I'm going to turn me to think that there may be <unk> in some activities or institutions that could have risen into others.
I don't have that clear.
But I can turn to opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were getting <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, follow <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still pretty <unk> they are usually a lot of the <unk>
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen.
But is this evidence for enough?
What <unk> opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you see is the <unk> attitudes, that people are doing some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> at the <unk> teachers.
I would probably ask the question, "To do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you might say, when you answered your question, "Well, I trust some some, but in other no."
What's really rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to be able to <unk> trust <unk>
We don't assume that the confidence we are going to feel like a certain kind of official or a <unk> or a person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain teacher of elementary school that I know to give you the classes of reading, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe a secret.
Simple.
And if we've gotten those evidence in our daily lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about the more <unk>
I think that surveys are very bad tools to measure the real confidence level of real trust, because they're trying to <unk> the good inherent judgment in the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's stupid.
Isn't that the goal I <unk>
I would argue to have more confidence in which it's <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
In short, I'm a <unk> of not to trust what it is not reliable.
And I think that those people who were doing their savings with the very <unk> call that then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> that's the right goal.
Once you say it says, yeah, OK, that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is to make a judgment on how trustworthy people in certain ways.
And I think that we can do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the raw commodities and is responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the other hand, they're not <unk> we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that they would take your own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have many friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I haven't yet <unk>
But that's what we are <unk> to do before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've been trying to build accountability systems for all sorts of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, that make us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember she was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that I will attend to <unk>
And we found the same problem in our public life, and we find that the system of accountability which is destined to guarantee the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know similar examples.
We <unk> all of that, in the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were trying to be trustworthy.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- the <unk> what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
And you get to the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should be able to reconstruct trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit trustworthiness.
We can do it if it's two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately is signature because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough bases so that they can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> usually for all people, all the time.
But you also have to say <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is all about every day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks on my socks -- he says I can <unk> not to be <unk>
I take it back and get it back and get it back to the money I want.
That's cool. I trust them because they become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you are worthy of trust and you have trust what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing is not very hard to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly <unk> more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
So first I created this tool that gets deeper into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen is <unk> their physical body <unk>
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool you break down the barriers.
But the two hands still remain out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of the hands?
In the <unk> division of <unk> Sciences with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
We <unk> a bombsight transparent with chambers deep to detect the fingers and the face -- now you can lift the hands of the keyboard, getting inside of the 3D space, and grab the pixels straight with your hands.
Like the windows and the files have a place in real space, <unk> it's so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and put lines or <unk> or words, with the virtual touch sensor that is down on every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we will be <unk> in the digital world.
And if we put the roles and make digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us would have bought and thought about things by the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about it.
What I have here is a virtual <unk>
This is the vision that you get from a device on the head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further away, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physicists so we can <unk> and <unk>
What would a future like that?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we create this only physical pixel camera.
This <unk> imam behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And as to program digitally the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach that physically and the famous distance from Michael Jordan can be reproduce as a physical reality sometimes that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the motion of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world will change our physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not just showing us something, but to start act directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without that we have to <unk> our world.
We started the talk today to talk about a barrier, but if you <unk> that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1950s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to teach a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my <unk> mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become an engineering, like them.
And after surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed strongly that there was only one moving path toward <unk> a safe work and <unk>
No matter if the work I'd like or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera singer in life.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could go to the opera school.
Until I wrote the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult <unk> the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends <unk> me, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much higher to train.
My dream never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life -- a second class was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
Nobody around me wanted to <unk> OK.
I would go to the books.
<unk> <unk>
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda a convenience.
The Bible is interesting, but <unk>
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> guilt <unk> and <unk> relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave me a <unk> habit.
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map would find me out of place because this is what students in China would learn.
I would never know that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading isn't something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields as comparative comparative literature and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offered to academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in life as well.
So I started reading books on two.
They can be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic and <unk>
For the Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and duty.
If you know other language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Rather than lost in translation, found that you can win a lot of it.
So for example, it's through the translation that I realized in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books set me a magic door to connect with people from the past and present.
I know I'm not going to go back to feeling or something.
Having a dream <unk> really <unk> compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that dreams come from where the passion, where your passion comes from.
Until a broken sleep, you can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex went into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> stood on my office in my office took off the shoes and he told me he wanted to talk about your problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My partner partner had a <unk> a client.
And I got a <unk> that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could manage it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it became easy to just move my head while <unk> the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said Alex, and for what I looked at, she was right.
You start to work after that, you go home after you have children later, to death later.
For <unk> like Alex and I had plenty of time.
But a little bit later, my <unk> pushed me to press Alex talking about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, he's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a head <unk> but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "No, not yet, but maybe <unk> with the next.
Also, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they were <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a <unk>
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized, that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences and not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, the families and the future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
That means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they think no one comes at age <unk> without passing before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, yeah. That's incredible.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take a <unk> like a <unk> I want to see. All right. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my view. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be in 35 years.
That means that eight out of every single 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give her life to life have happened to when you have 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> I don't want to panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know that more than half Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future couple at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up with its second and final stage of growth in its <unk> and it <unk> to the <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change from themselves, now is time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any time of life and we know that the female fertility comes to its top to the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are time to <unk> over their body and their options.
When we think about the child's development, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which its everyday life and ordinary life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in an adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
<unk> talk about changes in the line of the time of <unk>
And researchers call the <unk> a extended <unk>
<unk> would be <unk> names to <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to get big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not right?
What do you think happens when you get a <unk> in your head and say, "You get another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing happens absolutely nothing.
And then every day, <unk> intelligent, interesting <unk> like you or your children and daughters get into my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not <unk> I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "All they say as a career starts a race before 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better copy of the day I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> during the <unk> were like the chairs.
They all ran and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, it turned out the music and everyone started sitting on.
I didn't want to be the one who was going to go stop, so I sometimes think I was married to my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit better, but you don't <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge pressure on the <unk> and so many of you start a career, choose a city, to pick a partner, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that you start to show, which is a lot more difficult and a lot harder to do all of the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis crisis is not about buying blood sporting cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want to do now.
Notice that you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma got to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living very hard <unk> their previous life had even more difficult.
They were often <unk> in our <unk> but then he would get up to the saying, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost the time.
I had just bought a new project for <unk> and I had spent all the morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he stood up looking at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> by favor called <unk> please call <unk>
He was about to <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care if I <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> which was really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as for just sitting as a decade to sit as the 1950s.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> or woman, deserves to know.
First, I told Emma <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> identity capital.
For identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what you want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of the work, but I know this: <unk> capital makes identity <unk>
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that shouldn't count, which, by the way, it's not exploration, right?
It's <unk>
I told Emma that would explore jobs and make them count.
Secondly, I told Emma that the urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds that are limited to who you know, what you know, what you know about, how you think, how to think about, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who is going to go out almost always come from their closest circle.
The new things come from what they're called <unk> <unk> friends from their friends.
Yes, half the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half -- and the weak links are the way we would bring it to this group.
Half of the work created never <unk> then, knowing the head of your neighbor is a way of getting a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how the information happens.
For the last one, but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but yes to your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family when she has a partner and there is her own family.
I told Emma that time to choose his family had come.
You might think that 30 is better age to sit on my head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or you are <unk> now when all on Facebook start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that involves being as intentional in love as you are at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or kill time with anyone who is to share them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate in a quarter of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak <unk> helped him get a job there.
That set of work gave him a reason to leave a boyfriend, who I lived alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I send a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency emergency spaces are not enough enough.
<unk> story may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like planes coming from the airport airport, that come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits into its trajectory that makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good break, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my notion that the idea of spreading from all the <unk> you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> your <unk> get identity, they get identity, use their weak bonds -- choose your family.
Don't let me define why they didn't know what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job in management management for a work that was even more <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to graduate students in New York City schools.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and tests.
I gave them tasks.
When the work comes back, <unk> grades.
What struck me was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance did not have <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going to be doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for enough time.
After several years more than <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure in a better way.
It's the <unk> but what happens if successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn from fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
And we're trying to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and tried to predict what kids we would do as far as possible in competition.
We studied teachers working in real neighborhoods, working in real neighborhoods, to <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of the year and the <unk> who will be the most effective on improving the results of their learning <unk>
We teamed up with private, private enterprises, which of these vendors are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all of these different contexts, it emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and not the I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for years, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race at <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying determination in the public public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my questionnaires and then waited for more than a year to see who they <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly greater than <unk> even when they <unk> them on every feature that I could measure, or things like family income, the results of <unk> tests -- even the security that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> National <unk> which matters <unk> is also in school, especially for kids at risk of <unk>
To me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, how little science about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you develop your determination in children?
What should I do to teach kids a hard job <unk>
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the commonly determination is not related to whether it's related to the talent techniques.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing <unk> in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not <unk> that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mindset of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to do.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to start to get all of the new lessons from <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was <unk> by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can tear down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning Chinese might be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started to learn how to draw every single strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and easy way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read traffic signals -- pop-up menus to understand the basic idea of web pages or the newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you can, until it is <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to go for a ride.
<unk>
If the shape of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if it was shouting at a <unk> way, I'm <unk> this symbol of reality is <unk> in the form of <unk> but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call <unk> these eight characters.
They're building blocks for a lot of characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old man, two are <unk> three are crowd.
If one person stretch out your arms, this person is saying <unk> that's this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the foundations
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a <unk> tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember the fire?
Two <unk> it becomes very hot.
Three <unk> together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the bright moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out over the horizon.
A door. Get a chart inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played with someone at home?
This person is going out of a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, have care is <unk>
So we've been through almost 30 characters.
When you use this method, the first eight radical <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters would build other 32.
So with every small effort you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that learns a Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked one over the other.
In the old China, that meant in <unk> because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Nowadays, the diaspora has become <unk>
A mouth that tells you where it comes out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I must stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The movie <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
She gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and I will take a magic wand of it.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of industrial complex of child <unk>
However, the magician of Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took rise to 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a boy of metal and a boy would say, <unk> a girl dressed as his enemy <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a huge difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there is very little old violence in the <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think if the magician magician does this today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the <unk> generated by the <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing from the magician magician is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did look at Star Wars a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I had a son at the time.
About three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had <unk>  So slid in the room and was <unk> like a mom with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he would understand what he was going on, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It was the feeling that Luke get an army to <unk>
I <unk> this with the magician from <unk>
How does it make Dorothy your film?
We're doing good <unk> with all of them and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow in, OK?
Why is there so much energy force under the movies for our kids, and so little from the building <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I didn't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know for experience that Princess Princess doesn't give you the proper framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss.
My search is finished, I have <unk>
Why keep there?
I don't know what I should do.
So movies are focused on <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a kid, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are many exceptions, to defend the Disney <unk> to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though them, the boys, are not really their goal.
They make a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to fight against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our kids, and so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful topic of all time continues to come up in classic after <unk> each of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and their son, or two men who are <unk> a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Remember what the criticism was said when she came out <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films goes on the test of <unk>
I don't know if you heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and it's <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comics, and in the '80s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of a friend of the film assessment that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be <unk> in the movie, there are more of a female character that has lines?
So you have to <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something beyond the kid you like it?  OK? Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and they talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality, quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success is a consensus idea of what is a Hollywood quality film.
<unk> doesn't go through the test of <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "Let's get the bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's put it in the numbers.
In 2011, the 100 more popular movies -- how many of them believe they have <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, so it's fine.
But there's a number larger than this that is going to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one of five women says it's been sexually <unk> once in his life.
I don't think it's a mass <unk>
I don't think movies for kids to have something to do with that.
I also don't think that video music or pornography are tightly <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a huge amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do they don't get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We're <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools in our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we expect that to be <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our kids to keep it <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily the parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of man is changing radically changing.
You have read about how new economy is changing the role that you care about home and <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite <unk> favorite <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common these <unk>
Maybe it's not just the bright dress <unk>
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to get them to achieve their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories when I tell my <unk> Go and struggle and more stories where her work was to join a team, maybe a team that was led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine, and one of the things I liked was to look for the sea <unk> on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was going to get <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and archeology.
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up about 1,300 kilometers of length along the <unk>
And my biscuits grew up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see by using the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern Delta of Egypt called <unk>
And the place in the naked eye, it looks like to be brown, but when we use infrared it, and we're processing it using the fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old city, an old city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge continuous <unk>
This area is enormous, it's about about <unk> by <unk> kilometers.
Before, <unk> Nile right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find it random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we use data from NASA to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly high area that looks inside the circle here, which we think might be the <unk> location.
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like shots in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, under a thick <unk> <unk> we find a dense layer of <unk>
That means that in this possible location.
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common rocks used in the jewelry of the Empire <unk> these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have an evidence of an elite jewelry shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but <unk> the place in a near future to <unk>
And more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also do great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle East, probably been written by 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to TED it wasn't founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas actually have really started in 1984 B.C. -- in a lost city not for a long time and found from the high.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door of <unk> house.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now we put a group of obese <unk> <unk>
They're racing in a race of bike bicycles and they go back to your front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of your house.
There is bicycles flying around everywhere, wheels that they go on the side of the wheels that they end up in places that end up in <unk> <unk> the front threshold.
The hall to the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and see the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
He's waving with your hand.

It's a horse that I talk about.
You can feel your blue <unk> your tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you can see it is about getting into the mouth.
They slept on one side and go into your living room.
In the room, and doing peak of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
She is with little clothes, dancing about his middle <unk> singing <unk> One More <unk>
Now <unk> the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow opening path and from the oven coming to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping towards you.
Okay. You open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes on every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of us ladies and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- <unk> look at them just once.
They <unk> the names of tens of strangers.
It <unk> poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be <unk>
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best <unk> memories.
I said, "You know, when you realized when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I'm not a wise.
I actually have an average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition is they have normal memory.
"We have trained we've been trained to perform these miracle acts using old old techniques invented in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives and that <unk> <unk> used them to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I not hear about this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is wonderful and brilliant, although a little <unk> said to me, <unk> you are an American <unk>
That's Britney <unk>
I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of cards live in national television.
That will tell you the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what their potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad I didn't even remember that he had a problem of <unk> is awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how much our memory is that we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk>
We spend one afternoon in the public Library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And on the way back, I read a lot of treaties on the memory written over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined and <unk> not a thing as rare as you might look like today.
A long time ago, people investing in their memory, to provide their own minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
We have changed <unk> and I would say that they have changed the cognitive also.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it looks like we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you're still really passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a group of <unk> to the lab.
They wanted to be able to be able to have brains in a way, or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're even smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually not.
There was really a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of the memory of the memory of the memory and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them on an MRI MRI machine, they <unk> their brains as <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> found that in the memory of the brain, they found that in the memory of the brain, different from others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed to <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is driven by a armed race where each year has a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get to the day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times <unk>
On his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> which he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the <unk> <unk> digits <unk>
Yeah.
And while there is a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used to the end of the techniques that psychologists get down to a single concept that's called <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox -- he says this: I say two people who remember the same word -- I'm telling you to you, <unk> that there's a man called <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there is a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
So what do you <unk>
The person who was told that their name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that their work is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> capacity is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, doesn't really mean for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
All the other memories that dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk>
They get home when they go back home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you go to that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back two years ago, in Greece <unk>
It's called the <unk> of <unk>
History says this: There was a poet called <unk> who sat down to a <unk>
They had hired him as a entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring a <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up, <unk> his memory of memory, and he was <unk> and as soon as it was, the hall was <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed everybody, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
<unk> stood out only in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he'd been sitting every single day.
I took the family <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What they <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good to remember whether we're not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions for word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and <unk>
If I would tell you that I would take the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> you're very likely to be able to do it.
But I would bet that if you told me to say who was sitting on the horse on the horse on his <unk> they would be able to <unk>
The idea of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember. The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the image, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to do our memory, the same way that he would have done <unk> if they had been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on the <unk>
And that would you recall that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then in the kitchen, and the fourth subject that they would talk to be that strange journey that they did for a whole year and have some friends to help them it.
This is how speakers <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word for word, which is going to confuse it but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and at the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in its <unk>
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got into that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> <unk> event.
I mean, it's kind of like seeing a lot of people sitting on <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk> the front <unk>
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit down the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I found out that this was fun.
I would never have expected it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about doing is better and more the ability to create and imagine these images to imagine these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of mind.
I was really hooked on this.
This is me, using my computer training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of safety covers with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that had covered a year before, had the idea that I could <unk> in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment went out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be <unk> <unk> and phone numbers, and online lists but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks.
Because they are based on a lot of basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> or <unk> <unk> to profit from a little bit of <unk> about how their mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palace of <unk> -- these memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of them is not <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what I was going to do, the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is our short <unk> <unk> in <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walk into our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even have to process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are amazing memory capabilities on all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of architecture of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex, so <unk> just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> <unk> I was six years old, and I lived there at home of my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom. I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there everybody passed on the television. So every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everyone was published, and every time I <unk> and I would come back into a towel -- all of you.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> insecure and hated it.
I took that tour, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
That's right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or <unk> division -- but of those emotional connections that we feel in the places we <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- American <unk> they spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
<unk> determines in ways we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
That means that when I show you a building like this, I know what they are going to do, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it as being based on a building built a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> using architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a very, very long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, in the U.S., we used it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable, stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is really, really useful, because building stuff is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found up with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the <unk> Library of <unk> which ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has this round thing, has this round thing, columns, red brick -- that <unk> <unk> what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> the children, the values of ownership, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, got another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and to share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, just so much different <unk>
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects who constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for living forms of life.
We <unk> we gave them all so much, that we were completely from people.
All of the black stuff, this <unk> us, you think we feel very good, but we are dead because we don't have another option.
We have to go to the other side and go back to connect with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> -- so we started to experiment with <unk> we do go ahead and go ahead and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, you know, 30 years ago in the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
Something really really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started bringing these symbols.
I <unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that they like and <unk>
It is <unk> <unk> and we added <unk> and we use a new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we convert them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The shapes were <unk> they won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all went through the business malls we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or Italian or Italian <unk>
You might have a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we kind of visualize memories from other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated and started to swing the pendulum <unk> in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
So the <unk> symbols now have new design techniques for a computer, and we find new <unk> some ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You're totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> <unk> and general public and general were completely agreed on a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building <unk>
<unk> itself grows in a half thousand percent when they ended up the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first <unk>
But how is it possible that these wild and wild shapes, how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those forms perfectly functions and <unk>
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new country happened with other <unk> architects.
She went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the new millennium, actually began to go through all the architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption of information.
Think about it, for example, how do we use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology. You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers from architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere <unk> that means that the communications speed has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't take a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more, before knowing if which I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a two-year <unk> <unk>
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much <unk>
That is never going to be <unk> because we are at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> or the <unk> and the <unk>
My theory is that when we applied to media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until it is in both extreme extremes almost in <unk> and it was effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you know, the public.
We can now make symbols almost <unk> with emotional burden on something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building was finished with the building, it was already part of the community, and like the drawings looked exactly the <unk> they were not surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started to get into the social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a media, because this is not just images of a building, because these are not just images of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes it <unk> with our collective memory, and when you charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those <unk> <unk>
If that building has been built today, first of the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there is no unique response to what a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words that are using words and complicated, and one is no longer an <unk> public that doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
architects can listen, and you don't hear <unk> from architecture.
That means the <unk> <unk> of one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture -- and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different than the buildings today.
That means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
That means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historical <unk> of red brick with ideas of what it must be a <unk>
That means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways they're going to produce.
That means that the buildings will be transferred to the whims of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a parking garage parking lot means in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve for sport or to <unk> or even you can get married there at night.
That means that three architects can dream like swimming on the East <unk> of New York City, and raising half a million dollars of the <unk> community around that cause, is no one client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion, so <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to see.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, which matters is what we build.
Architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for everyone to want.
Finally, we are not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> an architect, <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
Buildings not only reflect our society, but they give them a way to the most <unk> spaces -- the local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the step to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just took a year and started walking.
And it does it in that great, typical way of children from a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves her <unk>
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself those big <unk> <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of his friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And made me think, When do you stop doing this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for <unk> "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as a teenager, he just wants to be liked and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
What his mom tells you and what his friends or school <unk> say, don't know who believe.
So a video of her, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal teenage teenager, who receives these answers on one of the stages of their most vulnerable living lives.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, teens today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure from being online and available all the time, talking to you, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never ends.
Never before we've been so connected in a continuous way, so they were so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in your fourth room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from your hand with that are <unk>
This environment, to be always connected, is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of liking they liked and the kinds of feedback that they get.
There is no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what is <unk>
What's the most important thing in somebody's life in front of what is normal in a context every day?
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> levels continue to dominate our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what young people <unk>
But the kids are also immune to this.
Like the <unk> stars of sports and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, to the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects are starting to be hurt.
Six out of 10 girls rather like not to do something because they think they don't look nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings and <unk> to society and to the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of every three teenagers are not interested in the class.
One in five are not attending at all at the middle class during the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the test season, if you don't think you look at it well enough, specifically, if you don't think you're good enough, you give a note lower to the average of your fellow who you don't care about the appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And it goes regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be very good enough, we're talking about how you see you, not what you're like.
Your self-esteem on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diet -- not healthy that they can take you to a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and are in higher risk of depression.
And we think that's all about what it is for what they make decisions, like alcohol and alcohol of alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetic relationships to early ages and without protection and <unk> damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether they have or don't have higher rates of <unk>
The 17 percent of women don't present to a work interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way they see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would it be that <unk>
We <unk> this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking about it alone, it's not very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key <unk> the first one is that we have to instill in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs that are available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really struck when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow not only a positive impact, but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key <unk> the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are crucial points for any willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
An education is <unk> but tackling this problem requires each of us to take charge in the issue and let's be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the status of as women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to tell with the contribution of our politicians in <unk> and the size of their <unk> or the size of its <unk> or the size of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a big beauty.
We need to start to judge people by what they are, not as you can see.
All of us can start doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can empower people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was the last time you had a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and as businesses, to change our culture, so our children will grow to valuing their entire person -- to grow their own <unk> diversity, <unk>
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
It's going to make a difference in the real world, let's make it the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that you can never see the <unk> of being who they are, or to achieve what they want to do in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who has in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk>
It might be simply the woman who is two straight away, what it would mean for her if she was released from that quiet voice in his interior, that he would pay for you not to have long legs -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we would <unk> this and would cause their potential to that way?
Right now, the obsession with images with images is <unk> all of us.
But let our kids the truth.
You know, the way that you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love for those who are and what they do, and because of how they make us feel.
They go back to self-esteem in our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, will become insurance agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On November five of November 1990, a gentleman called <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League defense <unk>
As initially initially were <unk> they were naive, but being a prisoner for other <unk> the other charges started planning attacks to about 12 icons in New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the 1993 bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't <unk>
Later on, it would be convicted of their participation.
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a loving American mom, teacher from the first two made it all possible for me to give me happy childhood, <unk>
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
So I saw that when people take time to deal with time, it doesn't require a lot to look like the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in all of the human group, there's always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> their convictions that think they need to use all the possible media so that everyone lived as them.
A few months before arrest him, he sat with me and explained to me that in the last weekends, and he explained to me that in the last weekends, he and a few friends, had been going to be done in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go to the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched my father <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on my shoulder, and explained to me how to point to the target at about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot <unk> I gave the little orange light on the goal and to surprise all of all, especially of me, all of my goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to others and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a parent, as a child.
And all of all, the comment had a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted they would be condemned to put a thousand pounds of explosives into the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability in my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about somebody who was already <unk> and going to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class often was <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white girl, but I will be the new one of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I went on home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons not developed social skills, to put it very <unk> to grow under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was opera, to judge people, based on <unk> <unk> like race or religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in my way to think, was during the presidential elections in 2000.
In a <unk> program where I was involved in the National Convention <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, like I had been <unk> <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group would come from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids had made friendship, was Jewish age.
I took a few days out of the light, and I realized that there was no <unk> among the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I was very proud of having been able to defeat the barrier that all life had made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer work in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I met people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
Every life had been taught that the <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
And I happened to have a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critical than I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a kid, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people, exactly the way I wish to be treated.
And so I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a kid, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how it is being homosexual but I know what it is to be tested by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All at night, Jon Stewart made me be honest with my <unk> and I helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with the character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to keep my heart forever while he's alive.
She looked at me with your eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At the time, I realized how much negative power you need to keep all that hatred inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I decided to go out and put me in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I have done that because I hope someone's one day, who is to take violence, you can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, than even though I was going to stand up to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make myself <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, and for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak against those acts of no sense, like rejection of my father.
With this <unk> I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that kids don't have to follow the roads of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.
At this point, there's a film that is projected in its minds.
It's an incredible <unk>
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound that you hear and you see right now -- but that's just the beginning.
Your film has color, tastes and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as a time of your childhood that you project in front of your eyes.
And it's constantly having a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The movie of the movie is you have to experience everything in it.
This film is your <unk> of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths about the existence of the human being.
Each one of us is conscious.
We all have a true internal film, you, you and you.
There is nothing that would take more directly.
At least, I know I have an <unk>
I don't have certain that you are aware of you.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of anything in our lives it would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we have to do what we get to produce the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective <unk>
<unk> by nature, is subjective stuff.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for nearly all the 20th century, we would get that vision.
<unk> psychology is <unk> behavior, and neuroscience was studying the <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few science jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to <unk> the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, an <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental constraints to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this kind of fantastic work I made Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feel like feeling or feeling <unk>
But this is still a <unk> science.
It's not a science of explanations science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain types of minds, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of neuroscience work answer some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what makes certain areas of the brain and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
I don't offend the <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real <unk> mystery of this <unk> Why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why does an internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon, like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors, how do we operate <unk> how do they work <unk> how they behave.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we talk about how we play <unk> -- all of these are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why all behavior is accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, doesn't actually have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works for a long time, my head was hitting the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end, I got to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to stand at this point.
We have a beautiful explanations chain, so we get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, the chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are aware of.
On the other, we don't know how to <unk> that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, it's kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate into our view of the world, but we don't even know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think that we need ideas that at the beginning, <unk> <unk> before being able to deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such a hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective film includes a sort of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain all the <unk> behaviors -- the behaviors of the brain, and that is studies of everything that needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a purely <unk> theory based on the brain.
At the same time, for a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I go in a different direction.
In the time that you get -- I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as a fundamental <unk> space, space and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> them as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything else.
On the contrary, they look fundamental and the way the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> <unk> discovered that you cannot explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts.
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you cannot explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas <unk> space, <unk> <unk> then for a question of logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the awareness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
That doesn't mean that all of a sudden it is not the object of science.
It opens up the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect to consciousness with other fundamental concepts space, the space -- the mass of physical processes.
<unk> sometimes tell us that we want fundamental laws so simple laws that we can do in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them on a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we want to.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everyone, <unk> in mind, every system is conscious, not only the human, the dogs, the mice, the flies, the flies, the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with anxiety when you think, "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But thinking is that perhaps photons can have some kind of crude sense of consciousness -- some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This might sound a little crazy for you.
How did anybody think about something so <unk>
So partly this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is critical.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time, and the dough, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like the others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea is <unk> it is a lot less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum to nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that make thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing information, there's consciousness.
<unk> of <unk> complex, as in a human, <unk> awareness.
<unk> of simple data, simple awareness.
Something really exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, a <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And I'm supposed to have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse -- there's one degree of information integration -- just as significant to consciousness -- rather important.
But when it comes to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
It actually brings a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of <unk> high <unk>
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers are often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it's not talking about the reality underlying the reality behind it.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of <unk>
From <unk> vision -- the equations of physics can be <unk> but they can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists basically are described to the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the awareness that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's in the center.
So this vision, I think, vision vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have a lot of social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get too hungry.
I think about thinking about this, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has an processing of information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right now, they are present very serious ethical problems about the development of the development of smart computers and <unk> ethic.
Finally, you can ask for the awareness of the <unk> the planet.
Canada has your own <unk>
Or a more local level, an integrated group -- like the audience in a TED Talk, at the time we have a TED collective consciousness, an internal film, an internal movie for this whole group of TED, different from every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually safer from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than by the second one, that is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go on the right way towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, that's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it at night in the morning.
But I think we're going to be able to be discovered.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile, an oily <unk>
I went to school, I was obsessed with my friends, <unk> my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came up to my parents, because he wanted to <unk> for a community <unk>
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's an obvious problem.
She didn't actually do anything.  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my mother's <unk> and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered a achievement.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school of <unk> as only after about 20 minutes in the class, 11 of <unk> studies -- a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when to give your <unk>
I said, "What do you think?
Well, I had been talking to you about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in wheels, they talk about things like <unk> things like <unk>
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was then when I realized, this boy had had some experience with people with disability as objects.
And we don't are. And it's not the fault of the boy, and it is to say, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there to inspire it.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you. Right? Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they have lied us relative to disability.
Yes, we have sold the lie that disability is a <unk> <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not a bad thing, and you can't make it really remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the girl with no hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with <unk> <unk> <unk>
And there are lots of these images, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn <unk> because we would go to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we will <unk> the disabled, in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and say, "Well, because very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that <unk>
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times I have been strange <unk> to express that they believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like I was getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images were <unk> people with disability with people with no disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things aren't such bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person, is actually something difficult.
Let's get a few things.
But the things that we die is not the things you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I <unk> the so-called social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more disabled, because of the society that we live in our own or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
So the things I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your ability to how you do, and that's what happens to the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're simply using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it does.
It's because of the lie because we have sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, they don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here -- the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not sometimes inspired by something that was <unk>
And I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability all the time.
However, I don't know that I'm lucky to have them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to charge the battery battery on the battery battery.
That's great.
We learn from force and resistance from others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk> us.
I really think that that lie that has been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: <unk> in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles at a stretch of stairs hasn't ever done it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> at a television screen, not going to come up with <unk> for <unk> people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people with disability that we are <unk> for the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a boy of 11 degree in a high school in Melbourne is not a bit surprised that their new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> does not make us <unk> but question what you think is to know about it that you do.
Thank you.
What do you need to do is augmented reality and professional football with the <unk>
What is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but reality reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and is going to happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because reality reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what's a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would play with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and knowing what is running through the game of play to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man from 110 pounds <unk> us <unk> trying to be <unk> with all its being.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
I took some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the hull, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the emerging technology is a submarine rising to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
Just a moment. It's a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the football field from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about feeling being in the field, but nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, being their favorite players -- and they have asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get into the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many people already know about.
The Rift Valley has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why why, with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no! I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man on a Russian rollercoaster for his life.
What would be the experience of a fan when I <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> which will be the experience of a fan experience.
When it can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball on the bottom of the network?
What is their experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we achieve reality <unk> <unk>
They <unk> reality as the <unk> the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So here is a quick review on the technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore had a <unk> in his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, more rapidly.
In 1994, the <unk> put in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and then in the <unk>
They got more <unk> because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player going back to your group and you see your next move in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you're wearing -- you don't have to worry about forgetting a <unk>
<unk> or <unk>
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate losing <unk>
If you lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your <unk>
How would you do that?
Well, a very simple option is to have a camera on every corner of the stadium in the stadium having a view from the top of the people on the bottom.
You also get information from the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all of that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
Bad people are <unk>
So this will <unk> the good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being <unk>
It would be also to <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field.
You get the ball and <unk>
You go to an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Normally, you don't <unk> but the <unk> system will be <unk>
They <unk> the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open receiver there.
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, but the receptor sees in its viewer an area of grass that lights and can modify the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed it from every angle.
This is something that makes a massive emotion on the game.
I'm going to make lots of people, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, right?
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think that we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is literally to be in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are in the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world as a <unk>
How much is it for a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of kids to think more about space and science instead of <unk> and <unk> notes.
Ladies and gentlemen, reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the choices we take and the challenges we face <unk> like all of us.
Thank you.
I recently told myself about 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years old, I got to the <unk> the southern end of the County, County <unk> that includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to <unk> for its beautiful <unk> view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a imam for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was opened up.
Joseph <unk> engineer who was able to build the bridge said that, "The bridge is pretty much to test <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some of them believe that traveling between the two towers will take you to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that every single one from it frees you out of all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go below <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that when the bridge is used for <unk>
After one every <unk> of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bones, some of which we make life organs.
Most of the dies of impact.
The ones that don't normally be <unk> in the <unk> water.
I don't think that <unk> this method of suicide will realize <unk> death to <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to bridge.
This is where most people get before they were to get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the darker time, it's very difficult to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young woman talked to a official looking at her life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had this day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal <unk>
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who would <unk> suicide, but the officers also.
We have a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official
This is Jason <unk>
I met him by July July last year when they got a call from a <unk> <unk> <unk> sitting on the cord near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked to Jason talking to a <unk> <unk> officer.
Jason was just 32 years old, and it had flown down here from New Jersey.
In fact, there were actually flown up there twice from New Jersey to try <unk> from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, the curiosity could be able to <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out of <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
And so Jason asked us, "What if you open up the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and it was gone.
This kind kind and intelligent kid in New Jersey had just been taking your life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing -- very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how it was.
The parents of Jason <unk> were <unk>
<unk> damage will be a lot of people.
I pose these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved <unk>
What do we find?
What do you say?
In my experience, there is not only to talk, but you have to listen to.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like it, because you probably don't know it.
You just stand there, you can be the turning point that you need.
If you think someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end their life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of them can save life and be the turning point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be able to say that there is nothing you can do to <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you his letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January <unk> this year, and he wrote this email only a couple of days, and he is his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go up to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing me more moments of realizing that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with their father the 19 of January.
He never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and the <unk> as disappeared -- that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my home and told me that the car of Mike was down on the bridge.
I had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the previous day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without having a real mental illness.
It should not be that easy to end it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 of 2005, I replied to a radio call for a <unk> subject on the sidewalk sidewalk near the north.
I <unk> my bike. and he watched this man, Kevin <unk> foot on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, she crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the time and half the next time, I heard about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to tell that day to come back about that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin <unk> <unk> him.
This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he made him <unk> and gave him to hope and life another <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "I'm <unk>
They stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events of the <unk> and you're one of the reasons that Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It has been diagnosed with mental illness for which it has been correctly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I was only six months old, completely unconscious from all those traits -- but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, like he says.
We thank God for you.
<unk> with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes <unk> When I visited the General <unk> Hospital that night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I did have to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and the active <unk>
He speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I have found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, I'm assigned to the opportunity to meet me.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who think about suicide, you wouldn't think someone else.
They just want their own chronic pain.
And usually this is achieved by three things: you can sleep, or drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've been <unk> and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and called suicide around the bridge.
Out of those incidents in which I've been directly involved, only I've lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
And for that time, I took my hand three times.
At the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that they leave on the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't just connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that all and every one of us should be able to use to do.
<unk> can be prevent.
There's help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you what you don't are, but in your inside, you know what you are, and a question is you going to tell you, how do you <unk>
I must be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone -- no way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I had finally achieved the dream that I had had since I was a child.
My outside would eventually come up with my inner truth, with my inner myself.
So for the reason for the reasons that I'm going to go further after me later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that <unk> I'm just getting started.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations imposed by the color of the skin or for the beliefs of those around us.
These are people who are always the status quo, they are considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, a lot of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent, even ignored my story.
I think this enigma is called epiphany.
This is mine.
I was recorded as a <unk> at birth because of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always wore this shirt on my head.
And my mom asked me, "Why is you always wearing that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair.
I knew how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I never loved myself to share my story, not because I thought to be what I'm bad, but by how the world deals with those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I thank you to be a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who would take me as I am.
Many aren't so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist <unk> of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these mysteries.
I was front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me. This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a technical beauty pageant.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you involved in the quiz competition.
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for the <unk> <unk> and <unk> And that night, I won <unk> and I won <unk> and became a <unk> among more than 40 candidate <unk>
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was from beauty of <unk> women, but I do can.
I also met the <unk> <unk> especially when I went to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mother who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that I passed my statement to the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you ask the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that I put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand at age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities do do to do the most sophisticated surgeries to do and secure.
In that time in the U.S., it was necessary to get the surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name <unk> and the gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document is to be able to drive or be able to drive a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears were <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York City, and to be model.
Many aren't so lucky.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> lived his truth, but he <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 of November we do a global <unk> for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people that were <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Gage P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth and only for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that one day there is no longer more <unk> than 20 <unk>
My deeper truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Oh, <unk> <unk> First, thank you to all my <unk>
My parents support, my parents especially, my parents -- that I know is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to <unk> young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and told me that their parents couldn't take the phone, and I would take my mom and say, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- others don't. It's just gender identity -- that's what's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everybody gave us a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table the subject that a few times that task was not block, and that there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be a space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies to the parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who was known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education in 2007. And when he <unk> his efforts in 2011, to <unk> the National Prize <unk> of peace, was made very popular in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the history of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, from violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when you were born, a little girl, his birth won't be <unk>
It's not welcome, nor for his father, not by your mother.
The neighborhood comes, gives your mother <unk> and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot of a mother for having a child.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when she <unk> her third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the suffering, the suffering, but the daughter is just <unk> when it grows, he suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she goes home and school giving her siblings.
Until 12 years in a way, he has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move around the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, he would stop to get out of your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of your house.
It's no longer a person.
It becomes a so-called honor of her father and her brothers and her family, and if they <unk> the code of that <unk> honor, you might even kill.
And it's interesting that this of course honor code doesn't only affect the life of a <unk> also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of her sisters in the name of the course of honor.
And there is a norm norm which is called <unk>
This is not supposed to be a good girl must be very humble and very <unk>
<unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepts the decisions of his father and her mother and the decisions and the decisions and the <unk> even if he didn't want to.
If you <unk> it with a man who doesn't like or if he <unk> with an old man, she has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If you were very young, he has to take it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And a lot before I <unk> I thought about his name, and was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she was born, when she was four and a half years old and a half and a half years old, my school.
So you might ask, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yeah, I must <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in <unk> societies in tribal societies is a great event for life as a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of your identity and your name.
One applied to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I went to the form of <unk> Canadian <unk> and I was at the relative to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason that they value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I sat down to sit with me when my friends would come to me.
The encouraged going with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to <unk> in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just to <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and girls in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, I taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we find a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's involvement in all the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
<unk> were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
Musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers was killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10, <unk> got up and got up on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper, he wrote a newspaper for the BBC, BBC, offered herself to the documentaries of the New York Times, and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign and nine in October 2012, was hit <unk> in his head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I read him to my wife and "I must <unk> for what happened to my daughter, to your <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't <unk>
Do you have a fair cause.
You know, your life in play for the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and for the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
So these few words were going to be a lot for me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had harsh headaches and strong pains, because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I am okay with my smile <unk> and with my face.
I'm going to be fine. Please don't <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we <unk>
<unk> and sisters, and sisters, have learned from her how to resist the hardest times, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women -- it's like any girl in 16 years.
<unk> when he didn't end up with the task.
They fight with her siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What about my <unk> which has made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I mean, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> in the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion for me.
I'm an engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently, I've been attached to the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work I'm going to talk about today about the science of the brain, I did before I join the science or outside of my work there.
Having said that, there is a stigma when you cling to a brain response.
Do you still be equally smart or not?
Doesn't be like this, you will be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to figure out how much to take over a dozen different chemicals every day, because if I didn't take nothing, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide to decide about the combinations of chemicals and mix them to try and keep them alive.
More than once I've saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided to try it to try and get the <unk> dose, because there really doesn't have a map of course that will tell you in <unk>
I started to try with <unk> <unk> and I was shocked to see how little changes in the <unk> doses -- my sense of who was me, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried to be a few months and philosophical chemicals for a <unk> man, and I was surprised to see how my thoughts.
I was always thinking about all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met various types of people, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as an end.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that had on the front, and it just wasn't going on that way.
So I couldn't manage it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about the men and what they have to do, since then I've gotten better with the men.
What I was trying to do is I <unk> those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, was to restore my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my <unk>
So let's think about almost always in pictures, and that became my point of key <unk> how to get these mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
There are the people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how the mind works, for me, is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right and I've got a lot of great <unk> mental, really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images from my mind to the screen screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a director of cinema was able to use his imagination just to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could get the music of your head?
There is incredible possibilities with this, as the way creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty of doing this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments done by two groups in neuroscience.
They both used to use MRI technology, MRI -- to represent the brain -- you can see the brain scanning made by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of a person who looks at an image.
The middle column shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as they were <unk> seeing that same image.
The column on the right is created <unk> the core of the central column on the left -- you see that the difference is <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagine seeing that same image is <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to convert brain waves into visual <unk>
So let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a large pool of reactions from the brain to the video array.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as much as they have a new <unk>
The computer using just the scanning brain of scanning the scanning thing to show you what it seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're pretty close to it.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you look at an image, and when you imagine that same image, you create the same <unk>
This is done with the scanning brain scanning systems, available today, and their resolution increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we <unk>
There are many techniques to do it.
One is open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer myself to that.
Many of them are proposing new projection techniques for images, even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI system, we need to ask ourselves the following thing, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way that you get more resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, the more <unk> magnets only offer small improvements in the resolution -- don't increase for thousands as we need.
I propose this idea, instead of bigger magnets -- let's make better magnets.
We can create a lot more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a huge amount of effort in MRI were to make really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious solutions, brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and basic radio prevalence in the MRI system.
On its time, instead of a magnetic field while they <unk> structured magnetic patterns structured the frequencies of <unk> radio.
So by combining the magnetic patterns with pattern processing patterns of radio frequencies -- we can increase the massive way the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can split up in layers our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood <unk> but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and maybe even the direct neural activity.
Will we put our ideas directly into the digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths about human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
That would be <unk> as a tool for amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure for Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have few choices more than opening up this door.
Anyway, you choose a year for a year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
Their closet probably is to say to some person for the first time your love, or tell someone who's pregnant, or telling somebody who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have to do in life.
All <unk> is a hard conversation and even though our issues can be able to <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that <unk> <unk>
Day fear, we don't like, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working on the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I had to go through multiple stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> -- I gave my armpits to quote the letters of <unk> I gave it <unk> like a <unk>
And to be the slope of my <unk> <unk> and so I had my head <unk> I would ask a little boy, and I would ask you a little boy, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And there would be a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I put my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper, the mother tossed a cold look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and I <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and ten years old, he was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I should be that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a kid or a <unk>
A familiar silence, but this time was prepared and I was about to go into the <unk> of female issues at the table.  I had <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues" I was <unk>
So I took a deep breath, and I looked down and my backs on my backs -- a <unk> girl in a dress -- and I would see what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just one girl with a question: "Are you guys or <unk>
So I took a deeper breath, again, I put it down close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a troubling.
I have the short hair like the one of a boy, and I saw <unk> <unk> but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to wear a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
Now, I'm more than a girl in a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was everything.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the most easy conversation for everyone I ever had.
And by <unk> Because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, my walls used to be a <unk>
But in the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how it feels like living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or you or you or your yours.
<unk> I'm going to give you 100 reasons why you get out of my closet more difficult to go out of his, but this is the <unk> it's hard not to <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who had declared in bank banking is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is harder than telling your five years than you are going to <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, just the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult to do about what it is difficult to do to another person to make us feel better or worse in relationship to our <unk> and we should just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine <unk> 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian prepared to fight any <unk> <unk>
I was frozen in the corner of fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay <unk> and to move only a muscle is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world would be <unk>
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable <unk> was in my sister.
It was the first time a lot of <unk> knew that I was gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew I knew I was doing years old.
And after talking about a moment, one of the women I went, <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay narrative had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and has never talked about having <unk>
<unk> What's your favorite TV show.
Our favorite <unk> Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in trying desperately to show her support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally he said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realizing the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you get.
That's how the hard conversations are still going to be my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have ever <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but you understand that what it involves any <unk> is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the cafe had no <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know that they're gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex complex.
You communicate your truth.
They would never be embarrassed by that.
And some of you can go out hurt by sure, <unk> for what they've done, but never <unk> what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to type.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you might feel too alone, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of what intelligence has seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of if a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this it made it as a criticism to the NASA pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, we would give a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step.
Let's first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth and the intelligence of the Earth, but they have amazing telescopes and you can observe the Earth, and they can look incredibly long lives, so you can observe Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from a alien race that doesn't know about this, that it doesn't have any concept about intelligence on Earth, you would actually would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to some point in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet, stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, which <unk> I think, to a single mechanism behind intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted to the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of potential future.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize future freedom in order to do complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked, asked several years ago: There's a mechanism behind the intelligence that we could get from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a strength, F, it acts in order to maximize future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future liberty of action or keeping open options with a force T, with the diversity of potential future accessible, <unk> Yes, to an impending future, <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to remain <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize future freedom and keep open options.
And so, having in account this equation, is the question: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
They <unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you a video that I think, to show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that those universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> in their life should be able to trend more favorable conditions for the existence of smart beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection, <unk> between entropy and intelligence, a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior isn't just correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually comes directly to it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple animal tests to play a game of humans, and even making money <unk> actions, actions, all of it didn't have to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a single foot of foot without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave it a goal.
He simply decided to be able to balance the <unk>
This skill skill will have applications for <unk> robotics and human <unk>
This ability of tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling up on opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can make a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
So for example, here we see that successfully playing a game of <unk> versus itself, <unk> its potential for play.
Here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly constantly getting constantly and keep successful the net yet.
This same capacity of network also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously <unk> and running a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of actions, successfully increasing assets under their management exponentially.
This skill management ability will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of marks of intelligent human behaviors such as using tools, walk upright and social cooperation, all flow from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
Let's go back at the beginning of the use of the term -- the <unk> <unk> there was always the concept that if we had smart machines, there would be a rebellion, <unk>
Machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of <unk> rebellion, in reverse.
It's not that the machines are getting smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It is all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all the future of all the potential is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, actually can actually emerge directly from taking control, instead of being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for targets we learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go through the descendants of helping them build artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence, or help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence, it must be viewed as a physical process trying to maximize the future freedom and avoid the constraints in its own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
And although in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how it fits the Earth into the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, which is that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that's measured the faint <unk> <unk> of stars when planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that will be done.
The data gathered by Kepler showing the sizes of planets besides the distance between them and their mother's star.
So together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like planets from our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their suns.
This gives you clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this treasure. of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014, was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us since a year ago now are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused on the global scale of a global scale of our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not science scientist or the weather, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet being influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone who is very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I'm looking for planets like the same Earth, more than our own planet.
Each one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newborn planet and the planets that we know for, the <unk> of our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world, shown that by a mission as the <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied both about Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> are tracking their surface searching for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission are taking samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Business companies now provide not just short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all these images were <unk> they remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas that are <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the most <unk> and <unk> places on Earth is fresh and filled with oxygen forests to thousands of miles away.
I'm worried that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will drag it into a great and sad <unk> the implication and the belief that some of the Mars Mars will expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable the Earth.
So I really like the exploration of <unk> exploration, I'm deep with this idea.
There are lots of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the first Titanic will have place in the <unk> of the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration, and environmental preservation -- not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens look like this.
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment called the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked, realizing that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found the evidence of the existence of alien life so far.
Well, where are you?
Well, a solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider to live between the stars, they lose the notion of how important to protect the origin of the planets that would promote this development.
It's arrogant to think that only <unk> colonization is going to save us from ourselves, but international preservation and exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments, of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I <unk> my own house.
And as I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were on the dining table, where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all all right.
I thought about calling a <unk> at least had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time to get to get it cold.
I couldn't go back to my friend of Jeff <unk> to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning, and I <unk> from my passport and <unk>
<unk> expensive, but surely they don't even more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, <unk>
I'm a profession of a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases the heart rate -- <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> thinking.
And when I came to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in place -- that would make bad things happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen, you get the likelihood that it's a total catastrophe for you.
So I started thinking about that, but until one month later, my thoughts didn't <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> winning the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I told him about breaking the window, and, I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called <unk> hindsight with me.
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that you could go wrong, then tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others aren't so evident.
So I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, you will get a place for things that are <unk>
That sounds common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the fact is, where the fish are, which places the fish are <unk> where tribes are living and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that are <unk> in the <unk>
It's the part of the brain that allows <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone actually did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and yet they could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move too much.
This is the reason for losing your car <unk> <unk> <unk>
So at home, you get a place for the keys, a hook on the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular drawer in your tracks.
For your <unk> a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and they're <unk> with it your stuff is always going to be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take with your cell phone -- a picture of your credit card cards, driver's license, you get <unk> on the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> it can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> thinking.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress will not be in the best time, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there is perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved self to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talking about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of making medical decisions and in fact to make it make financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take that would benefit from an rational assessment of facts.
So let's suppose you go to the doctor and the physician says, "I've got the outcome of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with higher risk of diseases -- heart attack, <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the physician says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard about <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today -- even likely you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you should do then, a statistic that is supposed to ask that most physicians don't want to speak, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number needs to treat.
And what is this, <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or <unk> into any medical procedure before they help a person.
And it has to think about what statisticians of <unk> is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me anything if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if she's <unk> it's from the scientists like me.
We haven't understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of the drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> which do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they can help a person?
300.
This according to the research of the cynical researchers -- <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independent <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, stroke brain or another <unk> event.
Now maybe I think, "Well, one chance in 300 to <unk> my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the recipe for everyone <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is, <unk> of the <unk> effects.
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include things that include muscle pain.
But a moment.
Remember, under stress doesn't think clearly.
So think about how to do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of them have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that a drug will help you.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is necessary. It's part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number on the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that more is done in the older men in the '50s, <unk> prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
That's what it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, produce 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think about time before the questions that you can ask to make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a lot of times, a lot of times, they want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change the <unk> of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that the whole bunch of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
You know, face with a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't go very quickly. You could get to be lunch for the lions, so nothing of it matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that is going on the window during those moments of stress is the ultimate thought of <unk> like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to <unk> to think about the future to this kind of situation.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail at a while.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help to minimize harm or to avoid that bad things going on in the first place.
I went to the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor set my contractor a combination of combination with the door, with a key to the front door in the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of messages I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> on the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more smoothly.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree in <unk> there you see that no matter how many thousands of <unk> and thousands of <unk> can be <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American American system, the <unk> besides a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the 1950s and over the time, it mixed with <unk> <unk> and developed the language we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, who lives in a world of sound, is like I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, <unk> behaviors and <unk> <unk>
So how do you understand the sound from?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like <unk> and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example here.
"You don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the <unk> bag of <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure not <unk> in the <unk>
All of this is called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound of the sound that I'm going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
<unk> it to continue.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is the equivalent of sound.
This is the signal to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, doing this with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, sound was the trend and that called me <unk>
There was no visual art, it was all <unk>
Now sound has entered my art <unk>
Is it going to be more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all I had taught about the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new job of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, he was <unk> with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized sound is like the money, the power, the <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was a <unk>
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could <unk>
I chose to be <unk>
There's a massive culture around language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me like the same and become my voice.
So in that way, I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, the work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And your voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when I was asking to <unk> their voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value as well as to take a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could <unk> in the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot be capture and fully expressing the paper.
And the same thing can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect the whole meaning of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor for me to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in many different parameters,
If you map a different <unk> for every finger while you touch the piano, like the facial expression, the <unk> of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand and like this, as it comes to the piano, English is a linear language.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need 10 fingers <unk> to express a very clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If just a key would change the <unk> it would create completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with the music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different parameters <unk> you can express different ideas.
So for example, the <unk> signal in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Oh, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the lens of music?
If I had to create a sign and it would fold it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
So for example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is the day."
If you <unk> and <unk> the visually speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be called <unk> <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is one hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present becomes closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea and dramatic at a time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific pace of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk>
Look at <unk> hand, <unk> right hand.
We have <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk>
Can you do that with me?
All of your hands on top.
Now we're going to do it both in your head like my chest, something like <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this -- please, do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please <unk> again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job, all work.
And look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and your chest -- but they carry very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy just like music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> has no sounds, it automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allowing the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> not to hear about learning music.
The <unk> is a rich treasure. And I would like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to <unk> your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a kid, my parents said, "You can do it all, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a <unk> bubble or a bubble of ignorance -- I must say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning other people's ones.
The past time, now I'm an adult and I teach civil school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, they're not drinking alcohol, and if they are, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been going out of these big ships and networks, and we would gather these bits of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use these huge boats too.
So along with my students, at age six to 15 years, we dream about making a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> work with <unk> <unk> so that the very <unk> children can also participate.
And I'm going to tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce the size that we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I'll leave you at the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas from every child and try to get them into something that we hope it will work.
We decided instead of collecting chunks of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the children would be <unk> a lot with robots.
Then we set up quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in the creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned light up and <unk> cameras, and you put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating floating through the sensor while the computer on board processing this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get a different estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention on a website on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would get it even further.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to solve immediately.
I was able to investigate my problem <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
You see the news, the Internet, the Internet, and they were <unk> with this image: right?
A kid, maybe less than 10 years away, cleaning a oil spill. Just using the hands in <unk> the world's largest <unk> in the world in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is <unk> where you live in.
You can see that the water is brown, the mud and the oil also are brown color, and when you get <unk> it's very hard to see what there is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what there is in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> which can <unk> through all sorts of things that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to look at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help <unk> other children.
I was forced to do a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away, maybe address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that he started a lot of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> farmers, various cities on the east coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a while."
It also gives the nuclear power plant of Fukushima, a nuclear power station close to water.
And today, according to the reports about 300 tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast of the Japanese coast -- and most of all, it has safe and is blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and research with other scientists, the land, the river, and we wanted to bring the children.
Of course they don't <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night you get to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks differently.
It might seem like they didn't take the serious job, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do next, <unk> <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
With this, we were able to notice that dust radioactive <unk> from the top of the mountain into the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an estimate of <unk>
But based on this we organized an civil expedition, the nearest of the nuclear power to date.
We get closer to 1.5 miles of the nuclear power, and with the <unk> aid from the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a <unk> <unk> as we were invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem with a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's become more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became so small and so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the larger space dedicated to impact and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology -- basically, you can build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where dreams of children can actually become reality with human aid, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, can we invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
So for example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the old age of transforming their standard food chairs.
<unk> the oil and oil and <unk> are <unk> <unk> but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the <unk> children because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, citizen scientists, creators, we should prepare the next generation to care about the environment and people, and so that they can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes <unk> two radically opposite <unk>
One is made out of thousands of steel parts, the one of the silk <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic <unk>
One <unk> on the environment, the other thing he believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
The <unk> was only a tool for Michelangelo.
But living creatures are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information that would need for each cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have been dictated a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects as <unk> from different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins is thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are <unk> with little <unk>
You act primarily like filter the other mostly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that varies gradually its functionality through variation.
Here's a split screen which represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect in working between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and synthesis, shown in both screens after me.
My job, at the simplest level, is about bringing these two visions of the world, away from the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why wasn't it possible this is about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment where you have four disciplines that offers designers access to the tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought we create.
Please know the minds and my hands of my students.
Are we designing objects, products, structures and tools through scale, scale, such as this robotic arm with a low-cost diameter arm with a <unk> base that some day not very far to print buildings and graphics made of <unk> genetically <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of ancient architecture, and it has created a screen where every <unk> is the unique size of the light and the heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion show, with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> between cells between cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This hull combines rigid and rigid materials at the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also a resolution of a <unk> scanner as well.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical <unk> and <unk> instruments that allows us to design products that are <unk> not only the way our bodies, but the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair at the same time, and comfortable and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator came back to the nature of <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
It <unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Your surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not through the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't have been raised in a religious subject, but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them got me and got to define a lot about what I really care about.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God send the Earth to make a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree that we had no difference between <unk> <unk> leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land made trees growing trees with branches, <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made from parts.
I often ask, "What would the design would be if the objects were made from a single part?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we are looking for the <unk> material the kind of tree material <unk> with fruit and and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year because of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We thought if we could tune into their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations we've been able to do a wide range of properties, from dark, <unk> and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print structures on a large scale, this is built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could be able to change the properties of the material and creating these structures made out of one material three and long, 100 percent recycled.
When the parts are ready, you will dry it in order to find a natural shape with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet ago, 3.5 billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems with <unk> <unk> and if they <unk> even more, the window.
A <unk> <unk> tree.
Working with an old stuff, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed to <unk> in the sea, <unk> life and put it into the ground, helps grow a tree.
The match for our next to explore using the same design principles were the solar system.
We are looking for the ability to make clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their <unk>
Just like the <unk> <unk> we did our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made out of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like liquid <unk> only instead of <unk> metals -- new biological zebras within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothing to <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
One turns the light into sugar, the other use sugar and produces useful biofuel for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship to a piece of clothes.
Think of that as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the <unk> <unk> that will help you get these bacteria and to make their way out of the way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material on the <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> to make more transparent channels.
This <unk> <unk> system is coming back from one end to another 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> channels shining with life within your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if the design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin -- and we would bring it down, hurt and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
And so you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer actually prints material down.
It also knows that nature doesn't do it like this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture.
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, <unk> these fibers to each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first turned into the environment, creates a tension, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk <unk>
However, when we put the silk worm in a flat <unk> not within a box, we realized that they would <unk> a <unk> <unk> and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different parts of the different parts of <unk> and we've discovered that way, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
Often they <unk> the silk worms to death in their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape <unk> <unk> one single <unk>
They were <unk> and we could create these things.
So we put this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making <unk> and we put it into our site.
We knew that <unk> silk <unk> to the darkest areas and <unk> so we use a solar system to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> in order to block the rays of light and the heat -- <unk> silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
<unk> <unk> silk <unk>
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much longer.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
<unk> biological silk on <unk> <unk> <unk> give all this pavilion its integrity.
And in a little bit of two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk> of silk.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products to the products and the buildings around us, to form a <unk> ecology, designers should bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired in nature to nature inspired by nature inspired by the first time, which demands us, for the first time, that we make in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them to do this?
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some type of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English and the <unk> and the art and I was doing websites and I also played the guitar into a punk band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard about us.
And in general I like to try and persist in any rate, because I have dedicated a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, gets to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I was struck by the other thing, something totally different, and I would get stuck on it, and I will just leave you and I feel <unk> I have found <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to find something different, and I would like to get a little bit into that.
This pattern made me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more <unk>
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for <unk> nothing.
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or being dispersed, or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something I'd like to have given back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they <unk> they learned about culture.
We ask first, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what it was to <unk>
It's considered a naive question to make beautiful answers to the kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk>
This question is about us over and over again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> high school students, ask them to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the beautiful exercise of exercise before the dream.
Why?
So if this is inspired by kids to dream with what might be, it's not inspired to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you cannot respond to 20 different things, even though adult people might be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The <unk> life notion is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to do about what you do for your time in this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and to dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that come up with curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with lots of interests and creative activities.
It's a breath for that to say.
Could you help if you divide up three kilometers -- multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms of the same thing that we can do with the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the middle of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
You know, whatever term you like or <unk> your own way.
It seems like a sort of adapt to a community, cannot agree with one single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or <unk> you should win.
But what I've learned talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests on developing data, visualization of data, travel, mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry.
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
So they come from the new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background, can you access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower, <unk> is learning fast.
When we <unk> we are interested in something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> because they've been a lot of times in the past, and this means we are less afraid of testing new things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> full-time and independent <unk>
As a child pianist <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I become a writer, <unk> was <unk> financial <unk>
It had to learn the <unk> <unk> <unk> when he was starting with practices and this ability to help write compelling <unk> for the editors.
It's rarely a loss of time to go into what you would do to you, even if at the end of it you will.
It is possible to apply that knowledge into a totally different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other web designer, sometimes <unk> of Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, it appears to be James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on their clients.
<unk> Magazine defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to flourish in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can <unk> to meet the needs of the market, which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas quickly and quickly learning, three abilities where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encourage <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers not to cope with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> <unk> knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there is nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams have a <unk> and a <unk> <unk>
He can dive deep into the depth and put ideas in practice, and <unk> provides a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all have to design lives and careers that interact with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> most of them are told to be told to be more like their fellow <unk>
And once said this, if there's one thing that you will take out of this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with your inner <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart attack, then, <unk> all the media.
That's where you get the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep your curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
We <unk> our inner wiring leads us to a more authentic life and the most happy.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year he went to a woman named <unk> they took her to a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until she was mostly passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found weird <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> brain.
The most amazing thing.
If you were going to have been living today, you couldn't give it more aid than the <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive diagnosis we now call Alzheimer's disease.
Since <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, drugs for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been done in Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's is now affecting 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the ability to get Alzheimer's will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that they spend their <unk> years with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or to be wanted to treat Alzheimer's disease.
Right now in the U.S., Alzheimer's disease costs 50 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare are spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease, and their costs of <unk> increase in five times by 2050, by 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death from all the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be able to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less from Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of it.
The U.S. government spends 10 times every year in the cancer research that Alzheimer's cancer despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and cause a number of a year of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to one more fundamental cause of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but all the <unk> world, Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of us, even scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We thought it will be <unk> in an inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy male brain, compared to the breast Alzheimer's patient.
In addition to trigger a severe loss of memory and mental ability, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease, reduces the life of life, and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> brain.
For nearly a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds out, well, these <unk> dots end up in the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots stay outside the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large <unk> and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step is complex, as <unk> a bomb.
I had a wire that could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we can do, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, most of them have shrunk the cables and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, and physical, physical, engineers, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we have managed to identify a critical step in the process. We're testing a new type of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened when these drugs were <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have a protein molecules that stick with each other within them, as in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms in a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but research like this sample Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince ourselves that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we fix it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have made more research and <unk> pressure on governments, industry.
That was essential to advance HIV to the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit of overcoming cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the <unk> <unk> <unk> of their loved ones and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs at the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who cannot create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
You know, this article in the New York Times, in January of this year.
In love to fall in love with this.
The paper is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience when we try it myself for a last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get <unk> and more and more and then both look at the eyes without talking about four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or ability what would be?
Number five: when was the last time you get to someone else person?
And <unk>
<unk> are getting more and more personal lives.
Number one: <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like from him or her -- I know very <unk> this time, and I gave things that you would have just known.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a little bit of really struck me about attention, the <unk> of that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the time I could test this study, with somebody who I knew not particularly good, I didn't expect to be <unk>
But I thought it was a good story, and I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the prefrontal column a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you might probably ask that some of you might probably ask, keep together yet.
And the reason I think they challenge this is because I've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
One week before the article was published that was very nervous, the paper.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had forced myself to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog blog can come to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just from my friends from Facebook and imagined that my article in the New York Times would reach a few thousand views.
And that found a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was published on a Friday night, and at night, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, already had been <unk> <unk> and the Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the article got over eight million pages, and I was, by saying something, <unk> for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage the confidence writing relates to our own <unk> experience, but another thing is to discover that life love of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call them or <unk> what they did every day for weeks later, the same question: still the same question: "Are they still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email from my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared right away.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed by radio and <unk>
They even gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers when they test the study with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public <unk> together.
We had television interviews, and we <unk> the <unk> requests of <unk>
I think it was afraid of becoming the <unk> icons of the <unk> process, a range of the way that I didn't feel at absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study worked -- they wanted to know if they really <unk> I mean, if I was able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just about a few months of months, and I felt, mostly that people said the wrong question.
How do you know if you <unk> together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, it would make the experience of doing these <unk> <unk> questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this study in 1997. And there, the goal of the research was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking forward to cultivate <unk> to college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study worked.
The participants were more close after doing that, several later studies, also used <unk> protocol -- as a quick way to create trust and interaction with strangers.
They've been used among members of the police and the community. And they have been used among people of <unk> political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I did last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited this article, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a <unk> liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
I said, "You want to tell you about the person who you <unk>
Well, he <unk>
I think she just wants to be friends.
I said, "But they became better friends?
<unk> they were able to get better better after proving the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that neither of you is looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation here.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was all about my adult life, and he was my first real love. And he had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I took to science.
And I did all that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized that at the time, I thought I just did this for the book that I wrote but in retrospect, it looks really <unk>
I thought if I was obsessed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and I used to feel that then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I am more patient with love.
I have more confidence to demand what I'm after.
But I can also look more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than you reasonably can demand for me.
What I'm looking for love is an guarantee not only to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to keep being <unk> out of the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people were asking when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there might be a shortcut <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very <unk> story, because in love, it makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it's about love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, still still together?
And its content with a response to <unk>
So more than a question, let's ask us to make some more difficult, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things were <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably has a relationship?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what to love somebody.
So, if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, one known and I applied a study designed to create romantic, romantic love, we still hold together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my <unk> <unk> love didn't happen.
They had fallen in love, because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> to read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I hadn't considered everything that was supposed to be that choice.
I didn't think we would have both to make that decision, and how much times it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded to 36 questions, to have chosen to love someone as happy and fun and having expressed that choice in the largest daily newspaper.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what you do, and what you might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the very happy implicit ending in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also will love, and it's frightening, but that's a deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by <unk> <unk> and in a way, I got a <unk> of the forest <unk>
I had a while.   Something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start when I was eight years old.
She took a wooden box, and he <unk> a dollar, a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our kind of <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, he's got <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment I was at <unk> <unk> I like to go from ride and <unk> and all these things <unk> and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took him all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> I Martin, I put it in the resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking she could <unk>
Instead, it happened to the opposite of it, somehow it seemed like the size of size, as if it was to be <unk> with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, and these strange bottles that I would find on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things my whole life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw into space.
I can flow <unk> draw like that you do about a dead body on a crime scene.
And I pulled out the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens from <unk>
First, <unk> that you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibits and those things, and I was earning some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point I was interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass sheets like drawing in a window in a window after another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together, which are three-dimensional composition
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work worked with something very big, I call <unk>
For <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's kind of ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double faces, so it's 10 feet per composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and the <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
You're going from the world of representation, to this <unk> <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the <unk> creatures are headed by <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a black god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is <unk>
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a look like the <unk>
It's a little bit a story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, it has a <unk> like a peak of bird, and spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail, a <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, their tail turn into fire on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that are going on, you know.
Its tail ends up in a <unk> eyeball made from terrorist cards.
They've been <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were to be baseball cards about terrorists.
Very <unk> at his time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a project of six years to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through the means of media and material or <unk> or <unk>
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of human being, and they travel into groups of 20, four or 12 at a time.
They're like cells, they come together, get <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's getting years old.
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds of a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave cave cave cave there.
That's the <unk> the <unk> is the <unk>
I'm going to play you through the rest of the body -- there is a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it has has a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick <unk> of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There's a little bit of pills that come out and go into the head of this strange <unk>
Is there a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We are in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a <unk> a museum, a <unk> a publishing arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
They took the box and all the people inside it hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that it's living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries from the borders, of religion, does not work.
We're all really made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when it hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill, has an effect against pain, first happens by the stomach, the bowels and other organs.
Take a pill, is the most effective system and <unk> so that any <unk> drug effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take <unk> drugs that are going to decrease the amount of virus in the blood, and increase the count of cells.
But they are also known for their side effects, <unk> in their most negative, because in time you take it into your <unk> your blood gets <unk> and even though the time it takes you to get to your destiny, which is where it's more important to be in the warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, our lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't be easily in the blood of the patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells <unk>
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with current drugs that are a treatment for life that is run by going.
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> I will get the treatment directly to the <unk> virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As an expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for care of wounds and surgery, they can be used for anything that is <unk> including <unk> transport of medicines.
In fact, we're using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, which open up and closing almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce medicines.
And the best people are asked, "What is that <unk>
We sent a little powerful laser beam on the cell membrane living with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro <unk> or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"What is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, that's our laser, we'll do a <unk> in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it goes to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of the infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to total HIV in the body.
Yeah. One cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researchers from <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've looked at armed groups -- not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
They <unk> what these groups do when they're not shoot <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to <unk> <unk>
I do work work in the world of politics and <unk>
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all of all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors.
For example, from the <unk> peacekeeping peacekeeping arrangements and 2011, <unk> had been signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any resolution of successful conflict <unk>
But how do you do that?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do, and how they do, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the <unk> policies <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also set a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the <unk> Palestinian known for their suicide attacks on Israel, also runs the <unk> in Gaza from 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting.
They're multitasking
We <unk> a complex machine of communication, the radio stations, TV channels and websites web and social networking strategies.
And here you have the print magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups also invest in complex fundraising <unk> but by business <unk> for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do more more <unk> they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, running hospitals, they run their professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population to offering something that the state of no safe and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in a Afghanistan torn on the war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups for providing safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price known for the population.
But in general, providing social services that means to fill a empty <unk> a <unk> gap for government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the <unk> victory of 2006 out of Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid ...
<unk> because they fill up gaps by the government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups participate in the violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and more sophisticated things are these organizations, we can least <unk> as something else to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
They were part of a landscape, running all of its <unk> they collect the trash system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines were <unk>
We live in a world of states of nations without state and hybrids and the weak the ones that are in the Middle East -- the more intervene and fill out that gap the U.S. actors.
This is important to governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in <unk> tools.
<unk> that <unk> of government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If you better understand groups better understand what incentives to offer to the transition from violence to nonviolent violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors not <unk> the military power can win some <unk> but not to deliver peace and stability.
To make these goals we need long-term investments to fill out that <unk> <unk> to fill out that empty governance that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the tag tag would be unfair for <unk>
I am a <unk> but it's pretty bad.
And therefore I would tell myself as a feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become a larger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had some weird ideas about the <unk> these women, <unk> <unk> with the men and who would be <unk> as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world and anger, in particular seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people in <unk> which might be feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a little taboo and disgusting.
I <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is required too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal to a man.
Nobody wants to be that <unk> woman, until you realize that it's actually that woman, and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> <unk> and also, proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as the free <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use easy and accessible the contraceptives and <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or <unk>
We have the right to the respect.
There is more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you need to have our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, gender of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, skills and much more.
We have to have these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this guy, our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive the job, I listen to rap music -- <unk> for volume.
Even though the letter degrades women and offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> of the Yin yang <unk> is incredible.
<unk> reality with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you <unk> the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm totally <unk> for my musical job.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks, but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of grass and maintaining <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of the fashion magazines and the nice stuff.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy tales, which are made true.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes more vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> the needs of color women, working workers, gay working and <unk> for white women, <unk> middle and high.
Listen, if that's good feminism am a very bad feminist <unk>
It also happens this: <unk> <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
Do we have this <unk> <unk> trend in a <unk>
We expect it to be really perfection.
When we were <unk> the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself to be <unk> from that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> for fear of what that tag means for fear of being able to fulfill the <unk>
Take for example to <unk> or as I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years it's a feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> in 2014, <unk> in front of the word <unk> in front of the <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show, seeing this pop star embracing Feminism feminism and <unk> women and young men who will be a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics were started <unk> whether we were going to <unk> it was not a feminist.
<unk> its feminism, instead of just believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection -- because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so <unk>
We go far beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism from any woman, <unk> until it's nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to <unk> to the action and become a little bit more <unk>
If I listen to music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy by providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions have to justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> <unk>
These are two <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant, and also very <unk> I want to grow in a world.
And they are given to the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them -- all of a sudden, the best option <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the canal when a television program is about sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women as nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies don't deal with women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting the professional sports where athletes treat their classmates as <unk>
In any case, men, especially young men -- <unk> guys can say, "No, I'm not going to post it in his magazine, participate in their project, or working with you, until it doesn't involve enough number enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also <unk> ourselves to be even more likely to be able to get the barriers to decision <unk>
Because we are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without adopting these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little kinds of courage and expect our decisions to come to the top, to people in the power directors, and producers of film and music producers and music, <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a change and significant change.
We can also say with courage -- our success, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, especially because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
A few guys told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as though it's nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all, I didn't think I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I <unk> in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of women who looked like me and they understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women that showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the script and of feminism, I also found that if I was a bit brave, another woman would listen to me and see me and realizing that none of us is the whole thing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to get anything.
And on the other, I hold the <unk> reality, that I'm only a woman.
I'm a <unk> <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope we could all be a little courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> for having visited <unk> or by being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things that comes out of this outbreak is that the <unk> which can be lousy for a child with a immune immune system is one of the most <unk> diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposed to be still <unk>
But a moment was not the article that sparked the argument about autism and vaccines <unk> unqualified and marked by being a fraud <unk> by the British Medical Medical <unk>
They don't believe most of the smart scientists that the vaccines theory cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines are in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the <unk> of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about her creating their whole professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates continued stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> funds like <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic, as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?"
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people at the Center for Disease Control in the middle of the <unk> what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> of diagnostic diagnosis, and a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that type of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks on the face of her son of two years, contact contact with visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria they had to <unk> why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the case of autism that were so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has been less to do with the slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the <unk> of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corner of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients that looked like <unk> worlds and private worlds -- people around their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by waving their hands on their faces, but they were prey to panic by <unk> like when they don't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the base of the patients being treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world in the subject, declared had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as they were <unk> <unk> of places like South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give that diagnosis to children, but now we know that <unk> is very common in autism.
Once he <unk> he had turned to nine out of 10 children to send her to their office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child <unk> caused by cold parents.
These kids, he said, they have been very carefully in a fridge that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they cluster into certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I was two years old.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like kids were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents <unk> desperate to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for the families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> science psychologist thought that the theory of mothers from <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and warm and <unk> and they had a little autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like <unk> without special education, no special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend ourselves to the National Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of prevalence in the general population.
We had a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse diverse.
Some children couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
Otherwise, these kids didn't fit very <unk> and <unk> as he said <unk> and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How did no one had no noticed these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even one translation to the English translation but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he <unk> it for her.
The paper offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who was leading an integrated clinic with a Catholic school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching kids with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary <unk>
The morning in the clinic started with music exercises with music, and kids follow their games on Sundays for late.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disability <unk> of life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as well as as well as <unk> who called them their little teachers, and they got to help in the developing methods of education that were particularly right for them.
<unk> has seen autism as a diverse diverse variety that included an amazing variety of <unk> and disability.
He believed that autism and the <unk> people were ordinary and they have always been, watching aspects of this continuous <unk> <unk> in pop culture like the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the 1980s and the early '90s, their changes in <unk> -- <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a wide and <unk> model.
These changes not fell on a broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people from all over the world to see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I went out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> recognition with <unk> <unk> <unk> and parents and parents around the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they were introduced to the first easy medical test to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of consciousness awareness.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that it was out of people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the diagnosis. A simple, powerful history of credible -- as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have joined together on the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are for solving by the new advances in medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to standard standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
People who are autistic people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
So 70 years later, we're still getting <unk> which believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities, communities, communities, communities, communities, communities, communities, communities, communities, <unk>
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the boat of the <unk>
As we <unk> towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
